            Growing up on the Eyre Peninsula of South Australia, Brad developed a love for the natural world. As a child, he spent much of his time in and beneath the water, and decided that the career path he would take once leaving school would involve the marine environment.
            Brad studied at Flinders University in South Australia, where he gained degrees in both Marine Biology and Ecotourism. He has since been working as a naturalist, guiding people across northern Australia and through regions of southeast Asia, where he enjoys educating people about the natural environment and the importance of its preservation for future generations.
            Brad has been working on expedition ships for the past two years in regions including the Kimberley of Western Australia, New Zealand and its sub-Antarctic islands, the Spice Islands of Indonesia, Borneo and Antarctica. Since he began working as a naturalist about five years ago, Brad has developed a keen interest in wildlife photography and is always willing to share hints and tips on how to capture that special moment while out in the field.
