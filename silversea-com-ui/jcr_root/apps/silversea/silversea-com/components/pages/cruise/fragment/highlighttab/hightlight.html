            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Thundering waterfalls, plunging gorges, Aboriginal rock art, deserted beaches, a plethora of wildlife and fewer people per square mile than almost any other place on earth — The Kimberley is one of</p>
            <p>Australia’s hidden treasures. This vast area located in Australia’s North West is three times the size of&nbsp;England and three-fifths the size of Texas — and much of it is accessible only by boat. Cruise by Zodiac through an untamed wilderness, spotting extraordinary wildlife, experiencing thundering waterfalls and marvelling at ancient rock paintings. Explore narrow channels, searching for eagles and ospreys in the mangroves and mud flats, and keeping an eye out for saltwater crocodiles. There are many beautiful places on Earth, but none is more beautiful than The Kimberley.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Day 1 — Broome, Western Australia</strong></p>
            <p>Embark <em>Silver Discoverer </em>for this stunning Silversea Expedition — The Kimberley, Australia’s Hidden Treasure. This afternoon, you will be introduced to your Expedition Team and attend a Zodiac briefing, and tonight we invite you to familiarise yourself with your new home away from home, meet some of your fellow travellers and enjoy the first of many memorable meals in The Restaurant.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Days 2-6 — Kimberley, Western Australia</strong></p>
            <p>The Kimberley is famous for having the second largest tidal range in the world after the Bay of Fundy. A flexible itinerary allows us to take advantage of this natural phenomenon. In the true spirit of expedition cruising, each day the Expedition Leader and Captain will determine our best course depending on tide, weather and sea conditions. Here are some of the places we may visit during our time in this wondrous region.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Nares Point &amp; Crocodile Creek, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong></p>
            <p>Nares Point is a long finger of sandstone protruding from the mainland alongside Koolan Island.</p>
            <p>With its convoluted photogenic rock formations, this is a superb location for Zodiac exploration and beach walks with our naturalists. In nearby Crocodile Creek — free of crocodiles despite its name — take a refreshing swim in the cool natural pool to relax and beat the Kimberley heat.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Talbot Bay (Horizontal Falls), Buccaneer Archipelago, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong></p>
            <p>The British naturalist David Attenborough described Horizontal Falls as “one of the greatest natural wonders of the world“. This group of over 800 islands was created millions of years ago by the erosive tidal changes. The region’s tides of close to 36 feet (or nearly 11m) create an amazing spectacle. Depending on whether the tides are ebbing or flowing, we board our Zodiacs for an exhilarating ride through the falls. Then continue deeper into the sandstone gorge of Cyclone Creek and explore geological formations that were created over the last two billion years.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Montgomery Reef, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong></p>
            <p>At Montgomery Reef, which is over 400 square kilometres (154 square miles) in size, we observe the amazing tidal changes that take place here. Timing of the tides is everything today; low tide reveals up to 13 feet (4 m) of reef exposing a river that allows access to this amazing semi-submerged world. As the tide continues to ebb, we use our Zodiacs to make our way to the edge of the reef where we are surrounded by cascading waterfalls up to 10 feet high (3 m), and continue up the river as we look at the abundance of reef birds and every imaginable sea creature including turtles, manta rays and, if we are lucky, the elusive dugong. A visit to Montgomery Reef is very tide-depending but truly a once in a lifetime experience.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Raft Point, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong></p>
            <p>At the Opening Ceremony of the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the world saw an enormous Wandjina spirit rising out of the ground. It was a breathtaking moment, and for most spectators their very first encounter with Aboriginal mythology. The image was actually that of a 114-foot sculpture (35 m) created by an artist who lives at Raft Point, home to indigenous Wandjina paintings. We zodiac ashore and set out towards the top of Raft Point. Our hike takes us through the abundant Kimberley Flora including the iconic boab tree, also known by the local Aboriginals as the “upside down tree”. Upon reaching the top of Raft Point, enjoy the spectacular views of the bay in the shade of the overhanging cliff, which is home to the Wandjina Spirit and many other Dreamtime stories and images representing daily aboriginal life. Take a seat, or lie on your back and take in the Wandjina Spirit and listen to the Dreamtime stories associated with this extremely important Aboriginal spirit.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Hunter River, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong></p>
            <p>The Hunter River is home to an immense mangrove system. Be sure to look for the image of the Indian Head in the soaring red sandstone cliffs as we set out in Zodiacs to explore the narrow mangrove channels, watching for numerous bird species and keeping an eye out for the <em>Crocodylus porosous</em> (saltwater crocodile), the most aggressive crocodile known to man.</p>
            <p>For those wishing to explore some of the Kimberley’s vast interior your on-board Silversea Expeditions team can arrange an optional helicopter flightseeing excursion to the famous Mitchell Falls where four tiers of waterfalls plunge into deep pools that flow out into the Mitchell River.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>King George River &amp; Falls, Kimberley, Western Australia</strong></p>
            <p>The King George Falls is one of the Kimberley’s most magnificent natural wonders. At 260 feet (80 m), the twin cascades are among the highest in Australia. We drop anchor at the mouth of the river and ride Zodiacs up this waterway, weaving through an amazing landscape of near vertical red rock formations and a parade of wildlife — carnivorous saltwater crocodiles and amazing birdlife, including giant raptors and the Brahminy Kite. Arriving at the falls, we can cruise quite close to the base to contemplate the immensity of this thundering spectacle — a truly humbling experience.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Day 7 — Wyndham (Bungle Bungle), Kimberley, Western Australia</strong></p>
            <p>Wyndham is our gateway to the breathtaking Bungle Bungle mountain range in Purnululu National Park, a World Heritage Site. For more than 350 million years, nature has shaped geological formations of giant orange and black striped domes rising out of the ground, a landscape unlike anything you have ever seen. Known to the local aborigines for thousands of years, the Bungles were only discovered by the outside world in the mid-1980s.</p>
            <p>Today take part in an inclusive overflight for an aerial view of these glorious panoramas, as well as seeing the majestic man-made Lake Argyle and Argyle Diamond Mine area from the air.Alternatively you can take a river cruise on the Ord River, looking for freshwater crocodiles, fruit-bats, short-eared rock wallabies and a variety of birds, including Mangrove Herons and Mangrove Gerygones.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Day 8 — Cruising the Arafura Sea</strong></p>
            <p>A leisurely day at sea permits you to take advantage of the luxurious amenities aboard&nbsp;<em>Silver Discoverer.</em>&nbsp;Attend a lecture to recap the fascinating Dreamtime mythology of the Aborigines or just relax in the comfort of your suite and watch a movie on the in-suite interactive television.</p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Day 9 — Jaco Island, Timor Leste</strong></p>
            <p>Timor is the easternmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands and because both Portuguese and Dutch settled in different parts of the island, it had been separated into a western and eastern part. While the western portion today is part of Indonesia, the eastern portion, which had been controlled by the Portuguese until 1975 and was tried to be annexed by Indonesia, finally gained independence in 2002 as Timor Leste.</p>
            <p>Silver Discoverer will head for the northeastern tip of Timor to anchor off the coast of small Jaco Island. The island is part of the Nino Konis Santana National Park and considered sacred by the Timorese. Although the island is uninhabited, Timor deer roam the interior.</p>
            <p>We will take our Zodiacs to land on the soft white shore and will offer botany and wildlife walks in the open woodland and monsoon forest. The island is an ImportantBirdArea with Bar-necked Cuckoo-doves, Pink-headed Imperial Pigeons and Streak-breasted Honeyeaters among other birds and will be of interest for Indo-Pacific coastal plants.</p>
            <p>This island offers the only opportunity for swimming and snorkeling during the voyage. To explore the fringing reef of table and staghorn coral with an excellent variety of tropical fish, snorkelers and swimmers can do so from the beach as well as from anchored Zodiacs.</p>
            <p>To make the most of our time ashore, the hotel department will set up a delicious barbecue lunch and will have a beach bar catering to the needs and wishes of birders, botanist, swimmers and snorkelers alike.</p>
            <p><strong>Day 10 — Cruising the Arafura Sea</strong></p>
            <p>This last leisurely day at sea will give you a chance to exchange notes with fellow travelers and to attend final lectures about the natural history, wildlife and human history of the area.</p>
            <p>Our onboard Videographer/Photographer will present the Voyage-DVD, letting you re-live the many moments of outstanding nature experiences had during this voyage through “Australia’s Hidden Treasure”.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Day 11 — Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia</strong></p>
            <p>Following breakfast, disembark <em>Silver Discoverer</em>.</p>
