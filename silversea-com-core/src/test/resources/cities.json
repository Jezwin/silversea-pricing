    "description": "The village of Alter do Chao enjoys a lovely location amid lush vegetation above the Tapajós River. The small settlement consists of rustic native cottages dotting the fringe of a tropical forest. Thanks to its beautiful sandy beach and the river's amazingly clear water, Alter do Chao has become a popular local weekend resort.\n<p>\nDuring the ship’s call, take the tender ashore and enjoy a refreshing swim or explore the small village. The Arariba Art Store has a good selection of indigenous art and crafts; many of the items are from the now closed museum. A number of stalls and street vendors offer local souvenir items.\n</p><p>\n<b>Pier Information</b>\nThe ship is scheduled to be at anchor. Guests will be taken ashore via the ship's tenders to the local jetty. The village can be reached on foot. Walking distance is about 500 yards, partially through sand. </p><p>\n<b>Shopping</b><br />\n\nAn open-air display and stalls offer Indian and regional wares. More upscale items can be found at the Arariba Art Shop. The local currency is the real. Most vendors accept US dollars (smaller denominations come in handy). </p><p>\n<b>Sights</b><br />\nAlter do Chao is primarily known for its gleaming white beach and extraordinary clear, fresh water. It is the only such place in the Amazon region, making it ideal for swimming. There are no facilities at the beach, so come ashore in your beach attire and don't forget sunscreen. Towels will be supplied from the ship.\n</p>",
    "short_description": "Dubbed the \"Carribean of the Amazon\" because of its crystalline waters, white-sand beaches, and laid-back vibe, Alter do Chão is a relaxing place to spend a few days in the Amazon. The village itself is simple, with only a handful of pousadas and restaurants, but Alter's cosmopolitan community unites hippies, herbalists, and healers with nature lovers and off-duty entrepreneurs drawn to the area's natural beauty.\nDuring the dry season (August–February), white-sand islands and beaches emerge from the green waters of the Rio Tabajós, the only clear river in the Amazon. During high tide, you can explore jungle trails or take canoe trips through the extensive network of igarapés and igapós(small flooded waterways). During the wet season (May–July), the rainfall limits many activities. Year-round, one of the best ways to explore is by boat trip, which allows you to visit the culturally dynamic communities within a few hours of Alter do Chão. There is an abundance of wildlife nearby, from monkeys to botos, the famous pink river dolphins.",

    "description": "<p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" align=\"justify\">Agadir is a holiday resort. Think sun, sea, and sand. These are what it does best, as hundreds of thousands of visitors each year can testify. There's no reason to begrudge the city its tourist aspirations. Razed by an earthquake in 1960 that killed 15,000 people in 13 seconds, Agadir had to be entirely rebuilt. Today it's a thoroughly modern city where travelers don't think twice about showing considerable skin, and Moroccans benefit from the growing number of jobs. There's a reason why this popular European package vacation destination is overrun with enormous, characterless beachfront hotels. The beach, all 10 km (6 mi) of it, is dreamy. A 450-yard-wide strip, it bends in an elegant crescent along the bay, and is covered with fine-grain sand. The beach is sheltered and safe for swimming, making it perfect for families. Further north, where small villages stand behind some of the best waves in the world, is a surfers' paradise. Even if you have no interest in surfing, diving, jet skiing, golf, tennis, or horseback riding down the beach, you can treat Agadir as a modern bubble in which to kick back. It's equipped with familiar pleasurable pursuits—eating, drinking, and relaxing next to the ocean—and modern amenities such as car-rental agencies and ATMs. It isn't quite Europe, but neither is it quite Morocco.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" align=\"justify\"><br /><b><br /></b><b>Dining<br /><br /></b>Neon signs throughout Agadir lure you in to sample not so much the delights of Moroccan cuisine as the woes of fast food and international menus. Nevertheless, many of these restaurants have good locations along the beachfront or in the town center.<br /><br />The main joy of eating in Agadir is the chance to dine in fish restaurants, which also tend to be the least brash and pretentious. Agadir's lively deep-sea fishing port is Morocco's busiest. And best of all, you can eat there, too. Frequented by locals and travelers alike, it's a great bet for cheap and fun eats. Each stall offers nearly identical food, including squid, prawns, sole, lobster, and whiting, and for nearly identical prices. So walk around and pick what you'd like; the better-organized stalls have chalkboards listing the catch of the day and the price. Eating at the stalls is a better choice for lunch (after visiting the hilltop kasbah, say), since at night the area is unlighted and stall owners can be a little aggressive.<br /><br />All major hotels have both Moroccan and Continental restaurants, and there are many sophisticated new eateries springing up around the new marina. Downtown there is a good selection of Italian, French, Thai, and even Indian restaurants. For some of the town's best seafood and a refreshing change of scenery, head to the warehouses and wharves of the port.<br /><br /><b>Hotels<br /><br /></b>For the most part, you can forget riad-style intimacy in Agadir; your choices are mainly executive-style functionality or giant beachfront complexes that cater primarily to European package tours. As a general rule the luxury (and price) increases as you move down from the northern tip of the beach. A room with beach views and access right off the property often costs a supplement of about 300 DH.<br /><br />The hotels along Boulevard du 20 Août<b> </b>have so many amenities and restaurants that you'll feel no need to leave their beachside complexes. Indeed, more and more hotels are becoming all-inclusive. Be wary of these, however, as they don't guarantee fine dining and many local experts think they will lead to a slip in standards. If you just need a bed while passing through Agadir, there are less-expensive, basic hotels in the center of town, north of the beach. There's also a lively trade in \"résidences,\" self-catering apartments which you can rent by the night. These even have communal hotel facilities such as swimming pools and are an affordable bet for families.<br /><b><br />Nightlife</b><br /><br />With its relaxed mores, Agadir is a clubbing hot spot, particularly for young  people looking to cut loose. Many places don't get going until 3 or 4 am, but  the beachfront is always busy earlier on, with diners and drinkers making the  most of the beach environment. Although Agadir lacks the class of Marrakesh, a  number of places, mostly based in the resort hotels, are putting up some decent  competition.<br /><br />Note: Nighttime also attracts many prostitutes, some underage, who throng the cheap bars. The authorities aren't afraid to imprison foreigners who patronize them.<br /><br /><b>Shopping<br /><br /></b><b>Palais du Sud</b><br /><br />For an emporium of carpets, ceramics, leather, lanterns, and ornate boxes, visit Palais du Sud. Behind the golden doors, all goods have price tags, which makes buying hassle-free. The store is closed on Sunday.<br /><br /><b>La Fabrique<br /><br /></b>You'll have to bargain hard for any of the leather goods and designer labels for sale at La Fabrique.<br /><br /><b>Scarlette Idées K-do</b><br /><br />Scarlette Idées K-do is a lovely boutique selling everything you could possibly want for the home, from candles and lanterns to mirrors, fabrics, and small chests of drawers.<br /><br /><b>Madd<br /><br /></b>Madd is a boutique jewelry store that entices you with 18-carat gold from behind a warm wooden exterior. There's another branch in the new Marina development at the north end of Agadir beach.<br /><b><br />Tawarguit</b><br /><br />Focusing on stylish crockery, Tawarguit also sells lamps, stools, coffee tables, gifts, and artisanal work. The owners have also recently added an art gallery at the same address.<br /><br /><b>Sights<br /><br />Agadir Beach<br /><br /></b>Agadir beach swings around a crescent from southeast to northwest. You're more likely to find a quiet spot if you wander south. The most crowded areas, frequented year-round by families and locals, are to the north. Along the flanking thoroughfare, known as the Corniche (promenade), you'll find inexpensive cafés, bars, and restaurants. At the very northern end is the swanky new marina development where private yachts are moored. The promenade can be a little sketchy at night, but it's still a good spot to stop and watch the world go by. The northern tip is also the place to rent a catamaran or surf equipment.<br /><br /><b>Kasbah</b><br /><br />High up on the hill to the northwest that looks over Agadir is  the old Kasbah. It's in need of restoration, but still worth the exertion to  make it to the top and back down to the port for a hearty fish  lunch.[]Emblazoned on the side of the hill below the Kasbah are three Arabic  words that keep guard over Agadir at all times. Their meaning? God, country, and  the king. By day they're a patchwork of huge white stones against the green  grass. By night they're lighted up powerfully against the dark. The huge hill is  really a burial mound, covering the old medina and the impromptu graves of those  who died in the earthquake.<br /><b><br />Vallée des&nbsp;Oiseaux&nbsp;<br /><br /></b>It's not so much a valley as a pleasure garden connecting Avenue Hassan II to the beach. It not only has birds, but also monkeys, fountains, and lovely green surroundings.<br /><br /><b>La Medina d'Agadir<br /><br /></b>In Ben Sergao, a few miles south of Agadir on the Inezgane road, is a remarkable 13-acre project orchestrated by Moroccan-born Italian decorator-architect Coco Polizzi. He dreamed of replacing the medina Agadir lost to the 1960 earthquake with a new medina on his own land. This combination of living ethnological museum and high-quality bazaar was finally completed in 2007 by hundreds of Moroccan craftsmen following centuries-old techniques. Each stone is laid by hand, and the buildings are made of earth, rock from the Souss, slate from the High Atlas, and local woods such as thuya and eucalyptus. Decorations follow both Berber and Saharan motifs. Mosaic craftsmen, painters, jewelers, a henna artist, metalworkers, and carpenters welcome spectators as they practice their crafts (and welcome customers for the results) in workshop nooks throughout the medina. The medina also houses restaurants, shops, and even an amphitheater.<br /><b><br />Musée Municipale du Patrimoine Amazighe</b><br /><br />Agadir's municipal museum celebrates the Berber Amazigh heritage of the region and features exhibitions of photography, jewelry, artifacts, and local handicrafts.<br /><br /><b>Souk Al Had<br /></b><br />In the northeastern corner of the city is a daily bazaar selling both souvenirs and household goods. You'll need to bargain hard.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" align=\"justify\"><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>",

    "description": "<p>Jordan is one of the most fascinating destinations in the Middle East, offering attractions that are manifold and unequalled. The country is not blessed with rich oil supplies; its treasures lie in the beauty of the land and a unique combination of antiquities, natural environment and traditions. The rose-red City of Petra and the captivating desert of Wadi Rum draw scores of visitors to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan each year. </p><p>\n\n\nAqaba is Jordan's only port and of tremendous importance to the country's economy. Countless trucks ply the route between Aqaba and the capital Amman, a journey of some 220 miles. With stark mountains rising in the background, Aqaba enjoys an attractive setting. For cruise vessels, the port provides the gateway for excursions to famed Petra and the spectacular desert and mountain region of Wadi Rum. Aqaba itself offers a string of shops, hotels and restaurants. Some recent archaeological discoveries in the center of town are thought to be the remains of the oldest church in the world, dating from the late 3rd century. Aqaba is also popular with diving enthusiasts who appreciate the great variety of marine life that abounds in the waters of the Red Sea. </p><p>\n\n\nPetra, the area's major attraction, lies 90 miles from the port. The remains of this once magnificent city date to the 3rd century BC when Nabataeans carved elaborate buildings out of solid rock. Abandoned and forgotten for centuries, the rose-red City of Petra was rediscovered in the 1800s. Excavations did not get underway until a hundred years later; the central section was unearthed after 1958. Today the site is recognized as one of the most spectacular attractions in the Middle East - a must-see for any visitor to this area.\n</p><p>\n\n<i>Please Note</i>: For your convenience, shore excursions offered for this port of call are available to reserve in advance at www.silversea.com, as well as offered for purchase on board, unless otherwise noted in the description. </p><p>\n\n\n\n<b>Going Ashore</b>\n</p><p><b>\n\n\nPier Information\n</b></p><p>\n\nThe ship is scheduled to dock at the Port of Aqaba. It is approximately 3 miles to the town center. Taxis are usually available at the port exit. We recommend establishing the fare with the driver before leaving the port. \n\n\n\n</p><p><b>Shopping</b>\n</p><p>\n\nLook for Bedouin rugs and tapestries created by local women. Brass and copper ware are also popular. Small bottles of colored sand from Petra with intricate patterns make nice souvenirs. Ladies may want to get some of the Dead Sea beauty products. The local currency is the dinar.\n</p><p>\n\n\n<b>Cuisine\n</b></p><p>\n\nMeals start traditionally with meze, or appetizers, followed by the main course, which may consist of roasted lamb or fresh seafood. Several small restaurants near the harbor offer tasty meals. </p><p>\n\n\n\n<b>Special Interest Options</b></p><p>\n\n\n\nDiving\n\n\nAqaba is known as a popular location for diving and snorkeling. The reefs in this area benefit from a constant supply of nutrient-rich water, which create one of the world's most diverse marine environments. Diving centers can be found a short drive from town. Guests wishing to make diving arrangements should contact the Tour Office on board. </p><p>\n\n\n\nPrivate arrangements for independent sightseeing may be requested through the Tour Office on board.</p>",
    "short_description": "<p>The resort town of Aqaba, on the Red Sea at the southern end of Jordan, is a popular spot for divers with some of the best coral reefs in the world. Snorkeling and other water sports are popular, and it's easy to hire a boat for a day or half-day, including lunch.</p><p>Aqaba has become quite a bustling destination, with several large luxury hotels and a large shopping area. There are many jewelry stores selling pearls, gem stones, and gold and silver jewelry. It's worth noting that although it's an international beach resort, Aqaba is quite conservative—certainly much more so than Amman—and North Americans tend to be more comfortable at the private hotel beaches.</p>",

A trailblazing streak is written deep into the city’s DNA, and icebreakers still crunch through its icy waters in winter, as research vessels depart north to explore the wilderness of the Arctic. The city lies fewer than 200 miles from the Arctic Circle, meaning summer offers spectacular opportunities to see the eerily beautiful sight of the sun’s rays spilling over the harbour’s waves in the early hours of the morning. <br /><br /><b>Exploring Archangelsk</b><br /><br />While Archangelsk’s trading powers may have been superseded by the founding of St Petersburg in 1703, the city remained historically important, and was used as a base by the Soviets, during the grinding war against Nazi Germany. Explore the region’s heritage at the Malye Karely museum, which offers a breathtakingly beautiful walk back through time, unwrapping an uncomplicated agricultural past. Welcomed by costumed guides, bearing gifts of salt and bread, you can explore this charming open-air museum of over 100 tottering timber churches, barns and windmills, which were gathered up from right across the region.<br /><br />Cast adrift in the waves of the White Sea, you’ll discover the gorgeous Solovetsky Islands. The beauty of these islands decries their shockingly dark past, during which they were used as terrifying off-shore prisons. As one of the most significant forced labour camps of the Soviet era, they witnessed the deaths of thousands of prisoners of war before being closed down in 1939, with the Second World War looming. Nowadays, visit to see creamy whales breaching the water’s surface off Belugas Cape, and to admire the spectacular UNESCO World Heritage Site listed monastery, which watches out wistfully over the waters, crowned by huge black baubles.<br /><br />Back on Archangelsk’s shores, some of the city's finest older buildings - constructed from thin strips of reddish brown wood - stand along Chumbarova-Luchinskogo Avenue - which is dotted with colourful flowers, places to eat, and a collection of statues and memorials. The curious Monument to the Seal, sits nearby, paying grateful tribute to the creatures who are credited with saving the city from starvation, during World War II's horrific struggles and food shortages. An ever-flickering eternal flame can be found at the Victory War Monument, which marks the sacrifices of a generation, and the devastating effects that the war had on this area and beyond.<br /><br />",

Rather, on nearly every street you'll find old and new side by side, with quiet corners where time seems to be holding its breath next to neon-lit Kalverstraat. Indeed, Amsterdam has as many facets as a 40-carat diamond polished by one of the city's gem cutters, from the capital, and spiritual \"downtown,\" of a nation ingrained with the principles of tolerance to a veritable Babylon of old-world charm. While impressive gabled houses bear witness to the Golden Age of the 17th century, their upside-down reflections in the city's canal waters below symbolize and magnify the contradictions within the broader Dutch society. With a mere 730,000 friendly souls, 179 nationalities, and with almost everything a scant 10-minute bike ride away, Amsterdam is actually more of a village—albeit a largish global one—that happens to pack the cultural wallop of a megalopolis. There are scores of concerts every day, numerous museums, summertime festivals, and a legendary party scene. It's vibrant, but not static (which is why the entry of the Grachtengordel canal ring into the UNESCO World Heritage Site list has not been greeted with universal joy). The city is making concerted efforts to broaden its appeal with initiatives like Project 1012, which aims to diversify the economy of the Red Light District. Just like construction in the rest of the city, Project 1012 is a work in progress, but there is light at the end of the tunnel. The scaffolding has come down around Museumplein, and new architectural landmarks, such as the EYE Film Institute across the IJ, are up. Despite the disruptions, it's impossible to resist Amsterdam's charms. The French writer J-K Huysmans fell under its spell when he called Amsterdam \"a dream, an orgy of houses and water.\"So true: the city of Amsterdam, when compared with other major European cities, is uniquely defined by its houses—not by palaces, estates, and other aristocratic folderol. With 7,000 registered monuments, most of which began as the residences and warehouses of humble merchants, set on 160 man-made canals (stretching 75 km [50 miles]), and traversed by 1,500 or so bridges, Amsterdam has the largest historical inner city in Europe. Its famous circle of waterways, the Grachtengordel, is a 17th-century urban expansion plan for the rich and a lasting testament to the city's Golden Age, the 17th century. <p>\n</p><p>\n<b>Dining</b></p><p>\n</p><p>\nHer sons and daughters having ranged the four corners of the earth for several centuries, the Netherlands have long offered visitors a vast variety of cooking, everything from a tongue-tingling Indonesian rijsttafel rice banquet to an elegant turbot on a bed of beetroot and nettle leaves. But if you're looking for real Dutch cooking, be prepared for sterner stuff—simple, solid nourishment with true belly-packing power.\nA prime example is the erwtensoep, a thick pea soup fortified with a variety of meats. Let the good local burghers save this magnificent brew for ice-skating time; true aficionados of Dutch cooking like this about 364 days of the year. It can be loaded with spicy sausages and pork fat; it's as thick as diesel oil, as rich as super-condensed cream, as inert as infantry pancakes, and sometimes as indigestible as green sawdust—but is it good! </p><p>\n</p><p>\nAnd one top reason why is because of the astounding quality of fresh ingredients available to Dutch chefs. Holland's national green thumb produces the continent's greatest variety of vegetables and fruits, its Gelderland lush forests yield the finest game, and because Dutch sea dikes are covered with rare herbs that nourish lambs and calves, this results in exceptionally tasty, tender meats year-round. Of course, the waters of the Netherlands offer up a briny feast of fish and shellfish. </p><p>\nNo wonder Amsterdam's top chefs have a no-nonsense obsession in bringing out the best in the ingredients and not drowning them in fusion-for-fashion's-sake finery. For them, \"New Dutch Cuisine\" has to embrace the traditional grass-roots values of organic farming. As with the Slow Food revolution throughout Europe, it is all about artisanal producers of farmhouse cheeses, great farmer's markets, and locally sourced provisioners. And we are talking local: the city's most forward-thinking chefs are now growing their vegetables and herbs in a plot actually attached to their restaurants. For them, New Dutch Cuisine is defined by farm-fresh, perfectly cooked veggies, and often-organic meat (or fish sourced from nearby areas): garden-to-table cooking, if you will. </p><p>\nBut let's not forget unlocal. International urban eating trends make it highly probable, on a walk through Amsterdam, to encounter a sushi shack, a soup shop, a Thai take-out joint, an organic baker of hearty Mediterranean breads, and an olive oil specialist. Most famed are the foods of the former Dutch colonies of Indonesia: the beloved rijsttafel(rice table), offering small plates of often-spicy fish, meats, and vegetables served with rice—a culinary experience not be missed. </p><p>\nAs for lunch, just follow the locals into one of Amsterdam's iconic cafés or bars (also often called an eetcafe, eating cafés) to have a broodje (sandwich), uitsmijter (fried eggs with cheese and/or ham served on sliced bread), or salad. Ask about the dagschotel (daily dish of meat, vegetable, and salad based on what was cheapest and freshest at the market that morning). If you are out only for a cheap, grease-enhanced snack, check out the infinite snack bars where you can buy—sometimes via a heated wall automaat—deep-fried meat blobs or french fries that you can order with an amazing range of toppings. Or try the many cheap Suri/Indo/Chin snack bars that serve a combination of Suriname, Indonesian, and Chinese dishes. </p><p>\nThe top taste? Head to the many fish stalls—or haringhandels—found on the city's bridges. The prime treat is raw haring (herring that has been saltwater-cured in vats). This working person's \"sushi\" variation is at its most succulent—hence, the usual onion and pickle garnish is not required—at the start of the fishing season (late May to early June). If this sounds too radical, there's always a selection of battered and fried fishes, Noordzee garnalen (North Sea shrimp, which are tinier, browner, and tastier than most of their brethren) and gerookte heilbot (thinly sliced smoked halibut). However, if you decide to indulge, gerookte paling (smoked freshwater eel), rich in both price and calories, is the way to go. </p><p>\n</p><p>\n<b>Hotels</b></p><p>\n</p><p>\nFor those who view hotels as an integral part of their travel experience—and not simply as somewhere to spend the night—it can be thrilling to stay in a listed Golden Age 17th-century gabled house, especially one furnished with antique mirrors, down-stuffed duvets, and a general sense of gezellig, a term that embodies the very Dutch notions of cozy comfort. </p><p>\n\nTo walk down medieval passages on the way to sleep in a four-poster bed, sit down to dinner before a baronial fireplace, have breakfast on a terrace overlooking a river that has flowed through history—all these flesh out the shadows that a lucky traveler feels in a city as time-burnished as this one. Behind many of the quaint decorative facades, however, are all the modern conveniences and luxuries one could hope for. So, go ahead: revel in the 18th century over morning coffee, and then get a head-start on your day by flicking on the Wi-Fi. </p><p>\nAccommodations throughout this city are egalitarian; no matter the budget, from grand hotels to family-run bed-and-breakfasts, easy access to attractions and idyllic canal views are available to all. Naturally, there's more to any hotel stay than the panoramas, which is where Amsterdam's hotels flex their muscles. </p><p>\nSolid standards keep reaching the next level thanks to such upmarket heavyweights as the stately InterContinental Amstel Amsterdam, the Okura, and the Grand, or the old-world Krasnapolsky, or the grande dame American—each offers doorknob-to-bedpost luxe. Although varying dramatically, these top places demonstrate how historic monumental buildings can be modernized and transformed into state-of-the-art facilities, providing rooms fit for royalty, business travelers, and tourists in one impressive swoop. </p><p>\nAt the other end of the scale, young backpackers can mingle in the city's hip hostels for as little as €20, while down-to-earth properties such as Museumzicht and Fita set exceptionally clean standards, serving customers with a smile and a personal local touch; chances are your room was scrubbed only hours, or mere minutes, before you arrived. If cleanliness is next to godliness, then Amsterdam's moteless hotels attain heavenly heights. </p><p>\nIn the middle of the price range, serene yet unexpected Dutch-flavored experience can be found around Vondelpark, where, at the Roemer and JL no. 76 modern luxury goes hand in hand with an eye for Dutch art and design. Also near Vondelpark is the charming Sandton Hotel de Filosoof, which will make you feel as if you were a 19th-century traveler visiting an old friend in a stately home; locals gathering in the lobby for weekly lectures and meetings give the place a definitive Dutch touch. Or what about the Exchange? It offers a Dutch-flavored experience of a different sort: each room has been uniquely designed by Dutch fashion students and artists. </p><p>\nOf course, the Netherlands continues to make waves at the forefront of European design. Thus it is little wonder that copious ink has been spilt about the gorgeous \"new\" Conservatorium, which has revitalized a grand old Amsterdam bank building. Inside, cutting-edge interior design and furnishings blend in with traditional elements and luxury is balanced with sustainability (even if you stay elsewhere you should enjoy a drink or meal in the soaring seven-story atrium). And then there is the worldwide buzz around the new Marcel Wanders-designed 122-room Andaz Amsterdam Hyatt, located in a former public library. Not yet quite open by press time, it is already causing a citywide stir thanks to the first photo images (guest room walls plastered with giant goldfish, etc.) </p><p>\nAll in all, Amsterdam's span of hotels befits a dowager who is ten centuries old but growing younger every day. Some visitors will choose the latest design hot spot, others will always opt for lodgings in an archetypal canal-house hotel. If you're one of the latter, just remember to keep a steady eye, and hand, out when navigating those traditional Dutch staircases. If you're not nimble-footed, find out in advance if you need to walk stairs at your hotel—how many, what type, and the degree of incline. And watch out for that last step out the door; if not careful, you might end up doing a slow breaststroke. </p><p>\n</p><p>\n<b>Nightlife</b></p><p>\n</p><p>\nEverybody knows that The Night Watch is the name of Rembrandt's most famous painting but not everyone remembers that, back in the early 2000s, it was also the nickname of a bunch of \"Night Mayors.\" This group of cultural leaders saw their role as fighters against the frumpiness that had cast a shadow over Amsterdam's night scene, thanks to the fact that the city fathers had cleared away the \"squats\"—the deserted buildings that were the settings for city's wildest nighttime events and raves. Now, ten years later, Amsterdam is happily experiencing a renaissance in its reputation as a true nightlife capital.\nThe city is still rich with inspired folk who are willing to organize a video arts festival in a cruise ship terminal, a gentle Bach recital in an ancient church, an arts festival in an abandoned factory, a house party in a football stadium, or some heart-stopping spectacle in a park. So get ready to savor Amsterdam's giant cultural wallop through its numerous venues—from former churches and industrial monuments to the acoustical supremacy of the legendary hall of the Concertgebouw. And the beautiful thing about the Netherlands is that if by the smallest—and we do mean smallest—of chances Amsterdam is slow one night, a short train trip to Rotterdam or the Hague will undoubtedly have you at the center of some cultural storm. </p><p>\n</p><p>\n<b>Shopping</b></p><p>\n</p><p>\nWhat will be your perfect gift? A folkloric koekeplank (cookie mould)? A Makkum ceramic herring platter? A box of those delicious hard candies called Haagse Hopjes? A cutting-edge vest styled by Viktor &amp; Rolf? A psychedelically hued ski cap from Oilily? Or one of those other delights that have made contemporary Dutch design the darling of high-style fans the world over? </p><p>\nWhether you go for Baroque antiques or for post-millennium fashion, the variety of goods available in Amsterdam energizes a continuous parade of boutiques, street markets, and department stores. Be it for the millionaire trade or economy-minded nabobs, hunting in Amsterdam for that special purchase is akin to grand entertainment. </p><p>\nWhere do shop-till-you-droppers love to melt their credit cards? Amsterdam's priciest street: the P.C. Hooftstraat, located in the Museum District and affectionately called the P.C. (pronounced \"Pay Say\"). Here, staff members treat customers like visiting royalty, BMWs are parked along the street, and many shop interiors mimic stately Dutch mansions, replete with marble floors, crystal chandeliers and antique furnishings arrayed for your comfort. Even if shopping the P.C. is beyond your budget, you might indulge voyeuristic tendencies and drink an overpriced glass of wine at one of the chic outdoor terraces while watching the Beautiful People parade by. Don't neglect the Van Baerlestraat and the Willemsparkweg, (just steps away from the P.C. Hooftstraat), where you're likely to discover a stunning lamp or home accessory. </p><p>\nAt the other end of the scale, tackle the more youthful crowds on the Damrak and Nieuwendijk, where shops blasting deafening music stand shoulder to shoulder, selling inexpensive fashions and club/street wear for the young and trendy, along with cheesy souvenirs. If it all gets too noisy and crowded, but you're not shopped out yet, traverse the Rokin, where it's more refined, spacious and quiet, with proportionately escalated prices. </p><p>\nAmsterdam is an antique-lover's paradise. Collectors, museum curators, and antique dealers routinely shop here for old Delft and Makkum treasures. The Spiegel Quarter is home to elegant antiques shops whose beautiful displays include a variety of antique art, maps, furnishings, jewelry and clocks. If you enjoy the thrill of the chase, explore the short, maze-like streets of the Jordaan, where you'll stumble upon a surprising number of tiny specialist antique businesses. The perfect Dutch \"antique\" is a piece of authentic Delftware. The key word is \"authentic.\" A variety of blue and white \"delft\" is available in a range of brands and prices, and you can pick up attractive souvenir-quality \"delft\" pieces at any giftware shop. But the real McCoy is known as Royal Delft and it can be found in the better giftware shops, such as those on the Rokin and the P.C. Hooftstraat, and bear the worthy name of De Porceleyne Fles. Blue is no longer the only official color; today, you can find \"New Delft,\" a range of green, gold, and black hues, whose exquisite miniscule figures are drawn to resemble an old Persian tapestry; the Pynacker Delft, borrowing Japanese motifs in rich oranges and golds, and the brighter Polychrome Delft, which can strike a brilliant sunflower-yellow effect. </p><p>\nAnother great gift is chocolates, as Holland is a chocoholic's mecca. Everyone knows the mmmmmmm-boy flavors crafted by Droste and Van Houten but, droolingly, we recommend one of the city's noted \"chocolateries,\" such as Puccini Bomboni. </p><p>\nIf you have enough time during your stay, shop at one of the outdoor markets for a \"total immersion\" experience and a sense of how old this city is. At the Albert Cuypmarkt, while bombarded by vendors hawking their wares, the multi-lingual hubbub and ethnic diversity of the crowd, and the exciting selection of goods, keep in mind that the scene before you is pretty much unchanged from centuries ago. </p><p>\n</p>",
    "short_description": "Amsterdam combines the unrivaled beauty of the 17th-century Golden Age city center with plenty of museums and art of the highest order, not to mention a remarkably laid-back atmosphere. It all comes together to make this one of the world's most appealing and offbeat metropolises in the world.\nBuilt on a latticework of concentric canals like an aquatic rainbow, Amsterdam is known as the City of Canals—but it's no Venice, content to live on moonlight serenades and former glory. Quite the contrary: on nearly every street here you'll find old and new side by side—quiet corners where time seems to be holding its breath next to streets like neon-lit Kalverstraat, and Red Light ladies strutting by the city's oldest church. Indeed, Amsterdam has as many lovely facets as a 40-carat diamond polished by one of the city's gem cutters. It's certainly a metropolis, but a rather small and very accessible one. Locals tend to refer to it as a big village, albeit one that happens to pack the cultural wallop of a major world destination.\nThere are scores of concerts every day, numerous museums, summertime festivals, and, of course, a legendary year-round party scene.

Its famous circle of waterways, the grachtengordel, was a 17th-century urban expansion plan for the rich and is a lasting testament to the city’s Golden Age. This town is endearing because of its kinder, gentler nature—but a reputation for championing sex, drugs, and rock ’n’ roll does not alone account for Amsterdam's being one of the most popular destinations in Europe: consider that within a single square mile the city harbors some of the greatest achievements in Western art, from Rembrandt to Van Gogh. Not to mention that this is one of Europe's great walking cities, with so many of its treasures in the untouted details: tiny alleyways barely visible on the map, hidden garden courtyards, shop windows, floating houseboats, hidden hofjes(courtyards with almshouses), sudden vistas of church spires, and gabled roofs that look like so many unframed paintings. And don’t forget that the joy lies in details: elaborate gables and witty gable stones denoting the trade of a previous owner.\nKeep in mind that those XXX symbols you see all over town are not a mark of the city's triple-X reputation. They're part of Amsterdam's official coat of arms—three St. Andrew's crosses, believed to represent the three dangers that have traditionally plagued the city: flood, fire, and pestilence. The coat's motto (\"Valiant, determined, compassionate\") was introduced in 1947 by Queen Wilhelmina in remembrance of the 1941 February Strike in Amsterdam—the first time in Europe that non-Jewish people protested against the persecution of Jews by the Nazi regime.",

Anzac, an acronym for Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, is best known for its 1915 battles and while the whole of the Gallipoli Peninsula is the site of extensive First World War battlefields and memorial sites, the haunting beauty of the north bank of the Dardanelles Strait is a poignant reminder of our past.

Bursting with memory, Anzac Cove is simply a must for all historians.  Part of the reason why the battle was so hard fought (lasting over nine months) was that the Allies were not expecting the topography of the village to be so brutal. Instead of gentle sloping shores of the rest of the region, they were met by enormous rugged cliffs, with an almost vertical drop down to the water below. However, the beaches themselves are geographically stunning and remain mostly untouched by mass tourism. The tiny, scenic cove itself gives way to spectacular raw seascapes that are not only remarkable in their beauty but both moving and stirring.",

Or you can escape to nearby villages where a beach chair, bucket of cold beers, and a good book is about as much as you’ll need to enjoy a relaxing afternoon in the sun.\n<p>\n<b>Sights</b>\n</p><p>\nAvenida Costera Miguel Alemán hugs the Bahia de Acapulco from the Carretera Escénica (Scenic Highway) in the east to Playa Caleta (Caleta Beach) in the southwest distance of about 8 km (5 mi). Most of the major beaches, shopping malls, and hotels are along or off this avenue, and locals refer to its most exclusive stretch from El Presidente hotel to Las Brisas simply as \"the Costera.\" Since many addresses are listed as only \"Costera Miguel Alemán\", you'll need good directions from a major landmark to find specific shops and hotels.\n</p><p>\n<b>Dining</b>\n</p><p>\nMost people come to Acapulco for the sun, but dining comes in a close second. Fresh seafood is on every menu, supplied daily by local fishermen. You can also get top-quality beef brought in from the Mexican states of Sonora and Chihuahua.\n</p><p>\nAs for location, you can have an utterly romantic meal high in the hills, with unparalleled views of the bay, or you can dine in a casual beachside restaurant. Night owls coming out of the clubs can even find a plate of flavourful tacos moments before sunrise.\n</p><p>\nYou can dine with the locals in Old Acapulco, or plan a half-day outing to rustic Barra Vieja, where you take a boat through the mangroves to one of many dining huts for fish grilled over hot coals. You can also head to Pie de la Cuesta, a laid-back area west of downtown. Here you can have lunch at a seaside eatery, go horseback riding, and then linger on the beach for a spectacular sunset.\n</p><p>\n<b>Hotels</b>\n</p><p>\nSnowbirds from the United States and Canada show up all winter, but the busiest times are Christmas week, Easter week, and during July and August, when Mexican nationals are on vacation. Most hotels are booked solid during these times, so try to make reservations at least three months in advance.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n<b>Nightlife</b>\n</p><p>\nAcapulco's clubs are open nearly 365 days a year from about 10:30 pm until they empty out. The minute the sun slips over the horizon, the Costera comes alive. People mill around, window-shopping, choosing restaurants, generally biding their time until the disco hour. Many casual beach restaurants on the strip have live music.\n</p><p>\nThe resorts often have splashy entertainment, sometimes with big-name artists. At the least, such hotels have live music during happy hour, restaurant theme parties, dancing at a beach bar—or all three. For a more informal evening, head for the zócalo, where there's usually a band on weekend evenings.\n</p><p>\nThe numerous quantities of clubs in and around, sometimes include drinks in their entry fee, and women usually pay less than men . In general, a higher cover calls for dressier attire, that is, no shorts. The more casual open-air bars are mostly free to enter, and shorts and T-shirts are common.                                                                                                                                               \n</p><p>\n<b>Salon Q</b>\n</p><p>\nThe so-called Cathedral of Salsa is a combination dance hall and disco, where the bands play salsas, merengues, and other Latin rhythms for young and old. Weekends see shows—mostly impersonations of Mexican entertainers.\n</p><p>\n<b>Alebrije</b>\n</p><p>\nThis massive club can accommodate 5,000 people in its love seats and booths, and it attracts a younger (late teens, early twenties) crowd. When the club first opens at 11, the music is slow and romantic; afterward there's dance music and light shows until dawn. The music ranges from pop to tropical.\n</p><p>\n<b>Baby'O</b>\n</p><p>\nSmall, and exclusive, Baby'O caters to the local elite. The club has long had the reputation of being Acapulco's classiest, and the well-dressed clientele lounges and dances in a jungle-inspired interior. It can be hard to get in, and even harder to get a table, but this is the place to go to see and be seen. It's closed Sunday and Monday in low season (May through November).\n</p><p>\n<b>Disco Beach</b>\n</p><p>\nAs the name suggests, this relaxed nightspot is right on the sands. It's so informal that most people turn up in shorts. The waiters are young and friendly—some people find them overly so, and in fact, this is a legendary pickup spot. Every Wednesday is ladies' night, when all the women receive flowers. Foam parties reign on Friday.\n</p><p>\n<b>Palladium</b>\n</p><p>\nA waterfall cascades down from the dance floor, which is considered by many to be Acapulco's best. It's also surrounded by 50-foot-high windows, so dancers have a wraparound view of the city. The club is so popular that it may take a while to get in.\n</p><p>\n<b>Baby Lobster Bar</b>\n</p><p>\nFrequented primarily by tourists, this lively open-air bar is on the beach and not far from other bars. You will get two drinks when you order, and the mood is conducive to meeting other people. Table top dancing is not discouraged, especially late at night.\n </p><p>\n <b>Paradise</b>\n</p><p>\nThe restaurant downstairs has beach access, a swimming pool, and lively dance contests at night. The open-air bar upstairs affords a spectacular bay view and it's a great place to watch bungee jumpers as they plunge from the 165-foot platform right next door.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n<b>Shopping</b>\n</p><p>\nGuerrero State is known for hand-painted ceramics, objects made from palo de rosa wood, bark paintings depicting scenes of village life and local flora and fauna, and embroidered textiles. Although many of Acapulco's stores carry jewellery and other articles made of silver, aficionados tend to make the three-hour drive to the colonial town of Taxco—one of the world's silver capitals. Stands in downtown's sprawling municipal market are piled high with handicrafts, as well as fruit, flowers, spices, herbs, cheeses, seafood, poultry, and other meats. Practice your bargaining skills here or at one of the street-side handicrafts sellers, as prices are usually flexible.\n</p><p>\nMost shops are open Monday–Saturday 10–7. The main strip is along Avenida Costera Miguel Alemán from the Costa Club to El Presidente Hotel. Here you can find Guess, Peer, Aca Joe, Amarras, Polo Ralph Lauren, and other sportswear shops, as well as emporiums like Aurrerá, Gigante, Price Club, Sam's, Wal-Mart, Comercial Mexicana, and the upscale Liverpool department store, Fabricas de Francia. Old Acapulco has a wide variety of tailors and lots of souvenir shops.\n</p><p>\n<b>El Mercado de Artesanías El Parazal</b>\n</p><p>\nIt's a 15-minute walk from Sanborns downtown to this market. Look for fake ceremonial masks, the ever-present onyx chessboards, hand-embroidered dresses, imitation silver, hammocks, and skin cream made from turtles (don't buy it, because turtle harvesting is illegal in both Mexico and the United States, and you won't get it through U.S. Customs). From Sanborns downtown, head away from Avenida Costera to Vásquez de León and turn right one block later. The market is open daily 9–9.\n</p><p>\n<b>Pal Kepenyes</b>\n</p><p>\nThe Hungarian artist Pal Kepenyes, who lives in Mexico, gets good press for his jewellery and sculpture (much of it racy and provocative), on display in his workshop.\n</p><p>\n<b>Minette</b>\n</p><p>\nDiamond jewellery of impeccable design by Charles Garnier and Nouvelle Bague is sold at Minette. There's also jewellery set with Caledonia stones from Africa as well as Emilia Castillo's exquisite line of brightly coloured porcelain ware inlaid with silver fish, stars, and birds.\n</p><p>\n<b>La Diana Mercado de Artesanías</b> \n\nOne large flea market with a convenient location is a block from the Emporio hotel, close to the Diana monument in Costera.\n</p><p>\n<b>Mercado Municipal</b>\n</p><p>\nDon't miss the market where restaurateurs load up on produce early in the morning, and later in the day locals shop for piñata, serapes, leather goods, baskets, hammocks, amulets to attract lovers or ward off enemies, and velvet paintings of the Virgin of Guadalupe.\n</p><p>\n<b>Arte Para Siempre</b>\n</p><p>\nThis shop in the Acapulco Cultural Centre sparkles with handicrafts from the seven regions of Guerrero. Look for hand-loomed shawls, painted gourds, hammocks, baskets, Olinalá boxes, and silver jewellery.\n</p><p>\n<b>Sanborns</b>\n</p><p>\nA countrywide institution, Sanborns is a good place to find English-language newspapers, magazines, and books; basic cosmetics and toiletries; and high-quality souvenirs. There are several branches; All are open 7 am to 1:30 am in high season and 7:30 am–11 pm the rest of the year.\n</p><p>\n<b>Maria Bonita</b>\n</p><p>\nThis shop has exquisite flatware, jewellery, and objets d'art.\n</p>",
    "short_description": "In Acapulco, you can opt for a lively party vibe by staying in the city, with its creative food scene, bustling waterfront promenade, and lively nightlife. Or you can escape to nearby villages where a beach chair, bucket of cold beers, and a good book is about as much&nbsp;as you'll need to enjoy a relaxing afternoon in the sun. Avenida Costera Miguel Alemán hugs the Bahia de Acapulco from the Carretera Escénica (Scenic Highway) in the east to Playa Caleta (Caleta Beach) in the southwest distance of about 8 km (5 mi). Most of the major beaches, shopping malls, and hotels are along or off this avenue, and locals refer to its most exclusive stretch from El Presidente hotel to Las Brisas simply as \"the Costera.\" Since many addresses are listed as only \"Costera Miguel&nbsp;Alemán\", you'll need good directions from a major landmark to find specific shops and hotels.",

    "description": "<p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\"> Considered Corsica's primary commercial and cultural hub, the largest city and regional capital of Ajaccio is situated on the west coast of the island, approximately 644 km (400 miles) southeast of Marseille, France. Founded in 1492, vestiges of ancient Corsica in this ville impériale revolve around the city's most famous son, Napoléon Bonaparte, whose family home—now the national museum Maison Bonaparte—pays tribute to the emperor's historical influence. Indeed, Napoléon takes center stage in this lively city of approximately 64,000 inhabitants, from the exceptional Palais Fesch/ Musée des Beaux Arts to eponymous street names and statues sprinkled around the town's accessible squares, gardens, and courtyards. Festivities crescendo in mid-August with a colorful three-day celebration to honor Napoléon's birth. Remnants from what was originally a 12th-century Genoese colony are still visible around the Old Town near the imposing citadel and watchtower. Perfect for exploring, the luminous seaside city surrounded by snowcapped mountains and pretty beaches offers numerous sites, eateries, side streets, and a popular harbor, where sailboats and fishing vessels moor in the picturesque Tino Rossi port lined with well-established restaurants and cafés serving fresh local fare.<br /><br /><b>Nightlife<br /><br /></b>Many of Ajaccio's top nightspots are 4 km (2½ miles) north of town, in the Santa-Lina District along route des Iles Sanguinaires.<br /><br /><b>Dining<br /><br /></b>The tables are always full at this popular establishment known for its traditional cuisine, fresh daily catches, and, in season, game specials such as <i>civet de sanglier</i> (wild boar stew), served in a bubbling earthenware casserole with cheese-infused polenta. The rustic interior has a starry sky above, antique lanterns, and stone fountain where guests pour their own water into ceramic jugs. In keeping with the familial style of service and food presentation, cutting boards with fresh-baked loaves of wheat bread are provided to start your copious meal. Three-course fixed menus are offered in two seatings at 7:30 and 9:30, and include an exquisite cheese platter with homemade fig confiture.<br /><br /><b>Shopping<br /><br /></b><b>Paese Nostru<br /><br /></b>Corsican crafts of all kinds are for sale in this tiny souvenir shop. Of special interest is the cutlery, hand-forged with wrought-iron and wooden handles.<br /><br /><b>Art'Insula<br /><br /></b>A large selection of leather, pottery and beautiful jewelry crafted by local artisans is available at Art'Insula. For the gourmand, there's an assortment of honeys, vinegars, and liqueurs.<br /><br /><b>Casa Napoléon</b><br /><br />This well-stocked boutique sells organic jams, olives oils, wines, and traditional dishes. It belongs to Charles Antona, who's been in business for more than 30 years.<br /><br /><b>U Stazzu</b><br /><br />Known for its high-quality cheese and wine, this award-winning shop offers some of the best hams on the island, including the waist-busting Coppa and Lonzu. Tasting is encouraged.<br /><br /><b>Sights<br /></b><b><br />Cathédrale Notre Dame de L'Assomption</b><br /><br />The 16th-century baroque cathedral where Napoléon was baptized sits at the end of rue St-Charles. The interior is covered with trompe-l'oeil frescoes, and the high altar, from a church in Lucca, Italy, was donated by Napoléon's sister Eliza after he made her princess of Tuscany. Eugène Delacroix's <i>The Triumph of Religion</i> hangs above the Virgin of the Sacred Heart marble altar from the 17th-century.<br /><br /><b>Chapelle Impériale</b><br /><br />In the south wing of the Palais Fesch, the neo-Renaissance-style Imperial Chapel was built in 1857 by Napoléon's nephew, Napoléon III, to accommodate the tombs of the Bonaparte family (Napoléon Bonaparte himself is buried in the Hôtel des Invalides in Paris). The Coptic crucifix over the altar was taken from Egypt during the general's 1798 campaign. Renovated in 2012, the somber chapel officially classified as a historic monument is constructed from the white calcified stone of St. Florent and worth a visit to view its neoclassical cupola and ecclesiastical iconography.<br /><b><br />Place Maréchal-Foch<br /></b><br />Surrounded by a row of stately palm trees, Place Maréchal-Foch is easily recognizable by its fountain of four Corsican granite lions encircling a commanding statue of Napoléon, the work of sculptor Jérôme Maglioli. Popular as a spot to people-watch on a sunny day, this triangle is surrounded by cafés and opens up to the Ajaccio port.<br /><br /><b>Musée des Beaux Arts-Palais Fesch</b><br /><br />This internationally recognized museum houses one of the most important collections from the Napoleonic era; it's undoubtedly one of the most significant displays in France of ancient Italian masterpieces spanning the 14th to 20th centuries. There are nearly 18,000 items, all part of an astounding inventory that belonged to Napoléon's uncle, Cardinal Fesch. Thanks to his nephew's military conquests, the cardinal was able to amass (steal, some would say) many celebrated Old Master paintings, the most famous of which are now in Paris' Louvre. The museum's beautiful vaulted corridors showcase 700 paintings, portraits, still lifes, and sculptures from the First and Second Empire from the French school. Don't miss the new gallery with engravings and drawings depicting historic Corsica. The building itself, constructed by the cardinal as the Institute of Arts and Sciences, dates back to 1837.<br /><br /><b>Marché Central</b><br /><br />For an authentic view of daily Corsican life, tour this wonderful open-air food market brimming with gastronomic delights. There is an array of local cheeses, charcuterie, breads, pastries, olives, condiments, and aromatic meats for sale. Traditional indulgences like chestnut-infused beignets can be savored in an atmosphere guaranteed to be lively and local. Bring your euros—cash is the preferred method of payment.<br /><b><br />Maison Bonaparte</b><br /><br />One of four national historic museums dedicated to Napoléon, the multi-level house where the emperor was born on August 15, 1769, contains memorabilia and paintings of the extended Bonaparte family. History aficionados can tour bedrooms, dining rooms, and salons where Charles and Letitzia Bonaparte raised their eight children. Period furnishings and antiques in Corsican and Empire styles are scattered about and pay tribute to the family's bourgeoisie upbringing. Head downstairs to see the cellars and granite oil pressing mill acquired by Napoléon III in 1860, which depict the importance of rural industry for the Bonaparte's income. Visit the trapdoor room and find the opening next to the door through which Napoléon allegedly escaped in 1799. The building itself changed hands multiple times through Bonaparte heirs until 1923, when it was donated to the state of France by Prince Victor, elder son of Prince Jérôme Napoleon.<br /><b><br />Eglise St-Jean Baptiste<br /></b><br />At the intersection of rue du Roi-de-Rome and rue Saint Charles, you can visit the <i>confrérie</i>, or religious brotherhood, of St. Jean Baptiste. On June 24, the patron saint is honored with a solemn mass conducted by the city's bishop and Corsican music concert.<br /><br /><b>Hôtel</b> <b>de Ville<br /></b></p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\">Ajaccio's town hall has an Empire-style grand salon hung with portraits of a long line of Bonapartes. You'll find a fine bust of Letizia, Napoléon's formidable mother, a bronze death mask of the emperor himself, and a frescoed ceiling depicting Napoléon's meteoric rise.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>",

    "description": "<p align=\"justify\">The Ionian Island of Kefalonia, also known as Cephalonia, is strikingly beautiful, with jagged limestone cliffs and terraced slopes dotted with olive groves. The highest point on the island is Mount Ainos, rising to 5,914 feet (1774m). Large areas are covered by luxuriant subtropical vegetation, and all around the island, the scenery offers magnificent views of the mountains and the sea.<br /><br />Many sites on Kefalonia reflect its tumultuous history of ever-changing kings and rulers. The Norman Kings of Sicily ruled the island during medieval times, followed by Italian overlords who ruled for three centuries under the principality of the Morea. In 1478, the Turks conquered the island only to be defeated twenty years later by the Venetians. And, for a short time, the British ruled here as well. Finally, in 1864, Kefalonia was returned to Greece. In 1823, Lord Byron spent several months on the island, captivated by the enduring spirit of the people, the natural beauty of the land and its rich history. <br /><br />Visitors to Kefalonia look to spend time in such places as the serene fishing village of Assos and the scenic town of Argostoli. Other highlights on the island include a Venetian Fortress, a 13th century castle, and spectacular caves.<br /><br />Argostoli, Kefalonia’s capital, lies on a peninsula projecting into the Gulf of Argostoli. Almost completely destroyed in a 1953 earthquake, Argostoli has been rebuilt in modern style. There is a small archaeological museum containing Mycenaean and Roman finds. North of town are the famous sea-mills, now partly buried as a result of the earthquake. While this busy town with usual traffic jams may not be the most picturesque town in Kefalonia it serves as an ideal starting point to discover the islands highlights. </p><p align=\"justify\"></p><h3 align=\"justify\">Pier Information</h3><p align=\"justify\">The ship is scheduled to anchor off Argostoli Pier. Guests will be taken ashore via ship’s tenders. The landing site is just in the centre of town. A few taxis are generally available on the pier.</p><p align=\"justify\"></p><h3 align=\"justify\">Shopping</h3><p align=\"justify\">There are a number of shops located at Lithostroto and Sitemporon area.

    "description": "<b>Ashdod, Israel</b>\n<p>\nBusy Ashdod is not only one of Israel's fastest-growing cities, it's also the country's largest port. Perched on the Mediterranean, it processes more than 60% of the goods imported into Israel. Home to many ancient peoples over the centuries, Ashdod today is a modern, planned city. It's also a convenient jumping-off point for exploring several of Israel's most interesting cities, including Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and Bethlehem.\n</p><p>\n<b>Sights</b>\n</p><p>\n<b>Bethlehem. </b> Today the great majority of Bethlehem's residents, as elsewhere in the West Bank, are Muslim. But for Christians the world over, the city is synonymous with the birth of Jesus. As well, Bethlehem is the site of the Tomb of Rachel, the only one of the biblical patriarchs and matriarchs not buried in Hebron.\n</p><p>\n<b>Church of the Nativity. </b>This is the oldest standing church in Israel. From the right transept at the front of the church, descend to the Grotto of the Nativity,  encased in white marble. Once a cave-precisely the kind of place that might have been used as a barn-the grotto has been reamed, plastered, and decorated beyond recognition. Immediately on the right is a small altar, and on the floor below it is the focal point of the entire site, a 14-point silver star with the Latin inscription: hic de virgine maria jesus christus natus est (\"Here of the Virgin Mary, Jesus Christ was born\"). Manger Sq..\n</p><p>\n<b>Church of St. Catherine. </b> Adjacent to the Church of the Nativity, and accessible by a passage from its Armenian chapel, is Bethlehem's Roman Catholic parish church. From this church, the midnight Catholic Christmas mass is broadcast around the world. Steps descend from within the church to a series of dim grottoes, clearly once used as living quarters. A small wooden door (kept locked) connects the complex with the Grotto of the Nativity.\n</p><p>\n<b>Manger Square. </b>Bethlehem's central plaza and the site of the Church of the Nativity, Manger Square is built over the grotto thought to be the birthplace of Jesus. The end of the square opposite the church is the Mosque of Omar, the city's largest Muslim house of worship. The square occupies the center of Bethlehem's old city. It has a few restaurants and several good souvenir shops.\n</p><p>\n<b>Rachel's Tomb. </b> This Israeli enclave in a Palestinian area is on the right shortly after passing through the border. The Bible relates that the matriarch Rachel, second and favorite wife of Jacob, died in childbirth on the outskirts of Bethlehem, \"and Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave\" (Genesis 35:19-20). There is no vestige of Jacob's original pillar, but observant Jews for centuries have hallowed the velvet-draped cenotaph inside the building as the site of Rachel's tomb. Islam as well venerates Rachel. Next to the tomb is a Muslim cemetery, reflecting the Middle Eastern tradition that it is a special privilege to be buried near a great personage. Rte. 60.\n</p><p>\n<b>Shepherds' Fields. </b> As you approach Bethlehem, you'll see the fields of the adjacent town of Beit Sahour, to the east of the city, traditionally identified with the biblical story of Ruth. The same fields are identified by Christian tradition as those where bewildered shepherds \"keeping watch over their flock by night\" received \"tidings of great joy\"-word of the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem (Luke 2). Two chapels-the Greek Orthodox Der El Rawat and the Catholic El Ghanem-commemorate the event.\n</p><p>\n<b>Dead Sea. </b> According to the Bible, it was along these shores that the Lord rained fire and brimstone on the people of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19:24) and turned Lot's wife into a pillar of salt (Genesis 26). Here, at the lowest point on Earth-the bottom of the world: 1,292 feet below sea level-the hot, sulfur-pungent air hangs heavy, and a haze often shimmers over the water. You can float, but you cannot sink, in the warm, salty water.\n</p><p>\n<b>Masada. </b> A symbol of the ancient kingdom of Israel, Masada (Hebrew for \"fortress\") towers majestically over the western shore of the Dead Sea. Its unusual natural form-a plateau set off on all sides by towering cliffs-attracted Herod the Great, who built an opulent desert palace here; it was the first site in Israel to be added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2001. To reach the top, most visitors make use of the speedy cable car. Starting at 8 am, it runs every half hour, with intermediate runs depending on demand. Maps, a detailed brochure, and a very useful audio guide are available at the top entrance. Adjoining the lower cable-car station is the <b>Masada Museum</b>, with hundreds of artifacts from the site. Especially moving is a set of 12 pottery shards, each bearing a single name. Archeologists believe these might have been lots drawn to decide the order in which the last remaining rebels would die. Off Rte. 3199, Ein Gedi. Admission charged.\n</p><p>\n<b>Old City Jerusalem. </b>Drink in the very essence of Jerusalem as you explore the city's primary religious sites in the Muslim and Christian quarters, and at the Western Wall, and touch the different cultures that share it.\n</p><p>\n<b>Church of the Holy Sepulcher. </b> Many Christians believe this is the place where Jesus was crucified by the Romans, was buried, and rose from the dead. On the floor just inside the entrance of the church is the rectangular pink Stone of Unction, where, it's said, the body of Jesus was cleansed and prepared for burial. The tomb itself (Station XIV), encased in a pink marble edifice, is in the rotunda to the left of the main entrance of the church. Between Suq Khan e-Zeit and Christian Quarter Rd., Christian Quarter, Jerusalem.\n</p><p>\n<b>Dome of the Rock and Temple Mount. </b> The magnificent golden Dome of the Rock dominates the vast 35-acre Temple Mount, the area known to Muslims as Haram esh-Sharif (the Noble Sanctuary). At its southern end, immediately in front of you as you enter the area from the Western Wall plaza (the only gate for non-Muslims), is the large, black-domed al-Aqsa Mosque, the third in holiness for Muslims everywhere. Jewish tradition identifies the great rock at the summit of the hill-now under the gold dome-as the foundation stone of the world. At the time of this writing, the Muslim shrines were closed to non-Muslims for an indefinite period. Security check lines to enter the area are often long; it's best to come early. Note: the Muslim attendants prohibit Bibles in the area. Access between the Western Wall and Dung Gate, Temple Mount, Jerusalem.\n</p><p>\n<b>Jerusalem Archaeological Park. </b> The site-often referred to as the Western and Southern Wall Excavations, or the Ophel-was a historical gold mine for Israeli archaeologists in the 1970s and '80s. Interesting Byzantine and early Arab structures came to light, but the most dramatic and monumental finds were from the late 1st century BC. Exposed to the left of the corner is the white pavement of an impressive main street and commercial area from the Second Temple period. The protrusion left of the corner and high above your head is known as Robinson's Arch, which was named for a 19th-century American explorer. Dung Gate, Western Wall, Jerusalem. Admission charged.\n</p><p>\n<b>Via Dolorosa. </b>The Way of Suffering-or Way of the Cross, as it's more commonly called-is venerated as the route Jesus walked, carrying his cross, from the place of his trial and condemnation by Pontius Pilate to the site of his crucifixion and burial; 14 stations mark the route. Muslim and Christian Quarters, Jerusalem.\n</p><p>\n<b>Western Wall. </b> The status of the Wall as the most important existing Jewish shrine derives from its connection with the ancient Temple, the House of God-it was part of the massive retaining wall King Herod built to create the vast plaza now known as the Temple Mount. With time, the closest remnant of the period took on the aura of the Temple itself, making the Western Wall a kind of holy place by proxy. (Expect a routine check of your bags-smaller is better-by security personnel at the plaza entrance.) Near Dung Gate, Western Wall, Jerusalem.\n</p><p>\n<b>Western Wall Tunnel. </b>The long tunnel was deliberately dug in recent years with the purpose of exposing a strip of the Western Wall along its entire length. One course of the massive wall revealed two building stones estimated to weigh an incredible 400 tons and 570 tons, respectively. Note that you can visit the site only as part of an organized tour. Western Wall, Jerusalem. Admission charged.\n</p><p>\n<b>West Jerusalem. </b>West Jerusalem houses the nation's institutions, is the repository for its collective memory, and-together with the downtown-gives more insight into contemporary life in Israel's largest city. The world-class Israel Museum and Yad Vashem are located here.\n</p><p>\n<b>Israel Museum. </b>The three main specialties of this eclectic treasure trove and world-class museum are art, archaeology, and Judaica, but the Dead Sea Scrolls are certainly the museum's most famous-and most important-collection. Ruppin Rd., Givat Ram, Jerusalem. Admission charged.\n</p><p>\n<b>Yad Vashem. </b> The institution of Yad Vashem, created in 1953 by an act of the Knesset, was charged with preserving a record of the Holocaust. The site's centerpiece is the riveting Holocaust History Museum, a well-lit, 200-yard-long triangular concrete \"prism.\" Powerful visual and audiovisual techniques in a series of galleries document Jewish life in Europe before the catastrophe and follow the escalation of persecution and internment to the hideous climax of the Nazi's \"Final Solution.\" Video interviews and personal artifacts individualize the experience.

    "description": "<p>A tourist-friendly town of about 45,000 inhabitants with a distinctly Spanish flavor, Alghero is also known as \"Barcelonetta\" (little Barcelona). Rich wrought-iron scrollwork decorates balconies and screened windows; a Spanish motif appears in stone portals and bell towers. The town was built and inhabited in the 14th century by the Aragonese and Catalans, who constructed seaside ramparts and sturdy towers encompassing an inviting nucleus of narrow, winding streets with whitewashed palazzi. The native language spoken here is a version of Catalan, not Italian, although you probably have to attend one of the Masses conducted in Algherese (or listen in on stories swapped by older fishermen) to hear it. Besides its historic architectural gems such as the Alghero Cathedral and Palazzo d'Albis, the fortified city is well worth a visit to simply stroll and discover local culture on narrow cobblestone streets. The city also has a reputation to serve great food at reasonable prices.<br /><br /><b>Dining<br /><br />Da Pietro</b><br /><br />The pleasing menu, which includes linguine with a sauce of clams, capers, tomatoes, and olives, and baked fish with a white-wine sauce, keeps this seafood restaurant with vaulted ceilings bustling. For dessert, sample sebadas, ravioli stuffed with mascarpone cheese and topped with honey. The various fixed-price menus help to keep the bill moderate. Look for Da Pietro in the Old Town near Largo San Francesco.<br /><br /><b>Sights<br /><br />Capo Caccia</b><br /><br />Head west of Alghero for broad sandy beaches and the spectacular heights of the imposing limestone headland of Capo Caccia. The rugged promontory, blanketed by thick maquis (brush), is home to Le Prigionette nature reserve and deep caves such as the Grotta di Nettuno. Close by are the beaches of Porto Ferro, Cala Viola and, on the beautiful Porto Conte inlet, Cala Dragunara.<br /><br /><b>Grotta di Nettuno</b><br /><br />At the base of a sheer cliff, the pounding sea has carved an entrance to a vast fantastic cavern filled with stunning water pools, stalactites, and stalagmites. You must visit with a guide; tours start on the hour. It's possible to reach the caves by boat or by land. Boat trips depart at regular intervals from the port of Alghero for €16 for the round-trip (admission to the grotto is extra). The dramatic cave and coves, discovered by fishermen in the 18th century, are some of the most popular tourist attractions on the island for their sheer natural beauty. To reach the grotto by land, you can descend the 654 dizzying Escala del Cabirol (\"Goat Steps\"), which are cut into the steep cliff here. By public bus from Alghero's Via Catalogna, the trip to the top of the stairway takes about 50 minutes. Allow 15 minutes for the descent by foot.<br /><br /><b>Torre Porta Terra</b><br /><br />This old stone tower fortress can be climbed for good views from the terrace. Stop at the interesting city history display on the computer terminals inside the tower. There's also a rotating set of exhibits and a miniature model of Alghero's Old Town.<br /><br /><b>Museo Diocesano d'Arte Sacra<br /></b><br />This cathedral museum is housed in a 13th-century church designed with Catalan Gothic architecture. The usual assortment of religious treasures—paintings, wooden sculptures, and bronze statues—is on display; look for the masterful 16th-century Catalan silverware, intricately forged with ancient motifs.</p>",

    "description": "<p>At first glance, it's hard to imagine that this resort destination, set in a verdant valley of the Lattari Mountains, with its cream-color and pastel-hue buildings tightly packing a gorge on the Bay of Salerno, was in the 11th and 12th centuries the seat of the Amalfi Maritime Republic, one of the world's great naval powers, and a sturdy rival of Genoa and Pisa for control of the Mediterranean. The harbor, which once launched the greatest fleet in Italy, now bobs with ferries and blue-and-white fishing boats. The main street, lined with leather shops and pasticcerie, has replaced a raging mountain torrent, and terraced hills where banditti (bandits) once roamed now flaunt the green and gold of lemon groves. Bearing testimony to its great trade with Tunis, Tripoli, and Algiers, Amalfi remains honeycombed with Arab-Sicilian cloisters and covered passages. In a way Amalfi has become great again, showing off its medieval glory days with sea pageants, convents-turned-hotels, ancient paper mills, covered streets, and its mosquelike cathedral. A plaque under Amalfi's Porta Marina bears this inscription: \"The judgment day, when Amalfitans go to Heaven, will be a day like any other.\" Visitors to this charming city, set in a verdant valley of the Lattari Mountains, will soon understand what it means. For sheer picturesqueness, it can't be beat. Drinking in the vista of the town against the sea from the balcony of the town's historic landmark Convento di Amalfi is like getting an advance on paradise. Amalfi's origin is clouded. One legend says that a general of Constantine's army, named Amalfo, settled here in 320; another tale has it that Roman noblemen from the village of Melphi (in Latin, \"a Melphi\"), fleeing after the fall of the empire, were first in these parts, shipwrecked in the 4th century on their way to Constantinople. Myth becomes fact by the 6th century, when Amalfi is inscribed in the archives as a Byzantine diocese, and the historical pageant really begins. Its geographic position was good defense, and the distance from Constantinople made its increasing autonomy possible. Continuously hammered by the Lombards and others, in 839 it rose against and finally sacked nearby Salerno, to which its inhabitants had been deported. In the 10th century, Amalfi constructed many churches and monasteries and was ruled by judges, later called doges—self-appointed dukes who amassed vast wealth and power. From the 9th century until 1101, Amalfi remained linked to Byzantium but also was increasingly independent and prosperous, perhaps the major trading port in southern Italy. Its influence loomed large, thanks to its creation of the Tavola Amalfitana, a code of maritime laws taken up by most medieval-era  kingdoms. Amalfi created its own gold and silver coins—or tari, engraved with the cross of Amalfi—and ruled a vast territory. With trade extending as far as Alexandria and Constantinople—where a large colony of Amalfitan merchants resided—it became Italy's first maritime republic, ahead of rivals Pisa, Venice, and Genoa; the population swelled to about 100,000, many of them seafarers and traders. As William of Apulia wrote in the 11th century, \"No other city is richer in silver, cloth, and gold. A great many navigators live in this city... famous almost throughout the world as those who travel to where there is something worth buying.But the days of wine and doges were about to end. In the 11th century Robert Guisgard of Normandy—in the duplicitous spirit of politicos to thisday—first aided, then sacked the town, and the Normans from Sicily returned, after a short Amalfitan revolt, in the 12th century. Then, when the Republic of Pisa twice conquered it, Amalfi fell into decline, hastened by a horrific storm in 1343, then by an indirect blow from Christopher Columbus's discoveries, which opened the world beyond to competing trade routes. By the 18th century, the town had sunk into gloom, looking to its lemons and handmade paper for survival. After the state road was built by Ferdinand, the Bourbon king of Naples, in the 19th century, Amalfi evolved into a tourist destination, drawing Grand Tour—era travelers like Richard Wagner, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Henrik Ibsen, all of whom helped spread Amalfi's fame.<br /><b><br />Dining<br /><br />La Caravella</b></p><p>No wonder this is considered the most romantic restaurant in Amalfi, with lace-covered tables, <i>ciuccio</i> (donkey) ceramics, tall candles, and fresh floral bouquets in salons graced with frescoes and marble floors. Opened in 1959, it became the first in Southern Italy to earn a Michelin star in 1966, and once drew a gilded guest list that included such fans as Andy Warhol and Federico Fellini. The menu maintains dishes favored 50 years ago: picture slices of fish grilled in lemon leaves marinated with an almond and wild fennel sauce. A tasting menu is available, but don't miss the antipasti.<br /><br /><b>Al Teatro</b><br /><br />Once a children's theater, this informal and charming white-stucco restaurant in the medieval quarter is 50 steps above the main drag. A house specialty is grilled squid and calamari with mint sauce, reflecting its position—suspended between sea and mountains. Try also the <i>Scialatielli al Teatro</i>, with tomatoes and eggplant. The pizzas from the wood-fired oven are terrific.<br /><br /><b>Il Tari</b><br /><br />Locals highly recommend this little <i>ristorante</i> a few minutes' walk north of the Duomo. Named after the ancient coin of the Amalfi Republic, the restaurant occupies a former stable whose space has altered little outwardly since those equine days, though the white walls, appealing local art, crisp tablecloths, large panoramic photos, and tile floors make it cozy enough. Winning dishes on the vast menu include the wood-oven-baked thin-crust pizza and the <i>scialatielli alla Saracena</i> (long spaghetti-style pasta laden with tasty treats from the sea). The prix-fixe options (from €20 to €40) are a great deal.<br /><br /><b>Stella Maris<br /></b><br />With its white awnings and prime location on the beach, Stella Maris is likely the first restaurant you'll encounter on arriving in Amalfi. Dining outdoors or in front of the glass walls, you can gaze at the fishing boats bobbing in the bay, or at the sun worshippers tanning on the small beach. The <i>risotto al pescespada</i> (rice with swordfish) is a treat, or try a pizza. If you haven't yet worked up an appetite, you can down an <i>aperitivo</i> or cocktail on the terrace.<br /><br /><b>Trattoria da Ciccia-Cielo-Mare-Terra<br /><br /></b>Big windows overlook the sky, sea, and land, and there's ample free parking, so this modern seafood restaurant on the Amalfi Drive (approaching from Conca) is a good place to stop if you're driving. The young owner, Francesco Cavaliere, will give you a warm welcome. After some perfect pasta—the <i>spaghetti al cartoccio</i> (spaghetti with clams, olives, capers, and fresh tomatoes) has been a specialty for half a century—finish up with the ricotta-and-pear cake, designed to accompany a tiny glass of well-chilled limoncello.<br /><br /><b>Da Gemma<br /><br /></b>Diners in the know have sung the praises of this understated landmark since 1872. The kitchen glistens, the menu is printed on local handmade paper, and Italian foodies appreciate dishes such as <i>paccheri con burrata e scungilli</i> (large pieces of pasta with cheese and sea snails). For dessert try the local specialty: eggplant and chocolate. Tile floors, white tablecloths, and a terrace set above the main street create a soothing ambience.<br /><br /><b>Taverna Buonvicino</b><br /><br />In the heart of medieval Amalfi, with outside seating occupying the small piazza outside the churches of Santa Maria Maggiore and the Maria Santissima Addolorata, this gastronomical treat is a testimony to the art of good food. Lovers of the craft prepare simple seasonal dishes using grandma's recipes—try the grilled squid or the buffalo steak. The inside eating area is painted in vivid yellow and Pompeii red, reflecting the wheat and wine used in this fine restaurant and wine bar.<br /><b><br />Lo Smeraldino</b><br /><br />Open since 1949, this airy, popular fish restaurant on Amalfi's almost-emerald waterfront dishes out reasonably priced seafood and <i>cucina tipica Amalfitana</i> (Coast cuisine) such as the tasty penne with tomatoes, cream, eggplant, peppers, basil, and cheese, or excellent grilled fish. You can see the boats bringing in the day's catch, and at night pizza is served on the terrace amid the twinkling lights of hills, sea, and sky.<br /><br /><b>Eolo<br /><br /></b>One of the most sophisticated restaurants on the Amalfi Coast, Eolo is run by the owners of the Marina Riviera hotel. The decor is suavely tranquil—white-cove ceilings, Romanesque columns, mounted starfish—but the kitchen is anything but, tossing out superb gastronomic delights patrons can accompany with one of more than 3,000 wines. Many dishes are fetchingly adorned with blossoms and other visual allures, but nothing compares to the view of Amalfi's harbor from one of the tables in Eolo's picture-window alcove. If you don't land one of these, don't fret—the entire room is pretty enough as it is.<br /><br /><b>Shopping<br /><br />Bazar Florio</b></p><p>Leather goods are popular items in small shops along the main streets; one good option is Bazar Florio, whose fair and friendly owner's stock includes handbags, wallets, and backpacks.<br /><b><br />La Scuderia del Duca Cartiera Amatruda<br /></b><br />A publisher of fine books and postcards, La Scuderia sells desk accessories, objets d'art, and beautiful art tomes about Amalfi.<br /><br /><b>Mostacciulo</b><br /><br />A well-known and respected family of coral craftsmen has run this shop since 1930.<br /><br /><b>La Dolceria dell'Antico Portico</b><br /><br />In the heart of Amalfi, this pasticceria boutique creates marvelous tortes, biscotti, and almond cakes.<br /><br /><b>Edicolé</b><br /><br />If you're pining for English-language newspapers, wanting a book on Amalfi's history, or just looking for a suitable poolside novel, try this shop near the tourist office.<br /><br /><b>Sights<br /><br />Duomo di Sant' Andrea<br /><br /></b>Complicated, grand, delicate, and dominating, the 9th-century Amalfi cathedral has been remodeled over the years with Romanesque, Byzantine, Gothic, and baroque elements, but retains a predominantly Arab-Norman style. Cross and crescent seem to be wed here: the campanile, spliced with Saracen colors and the intricate tile work of High Barbery, looks like a minaret wearing a Scheherazadian turban, the facade conjures up a striped burnoose, and its <b>Chiostro del Paradiso</b> (Paradise Cloister) is an Arab-Sicilian spectacular. Built around 1266 as a burial ground for Amalfi's elite, the cloister, the first stop on a tour of the cathedral, is one of southern Italy's architectural treasures. Its flower-and-palm-filled quadrangle has a series of exceptionally delicate intertwining arches on slender double columns.[]The chapel at the back of the cloister leads into the earlier (9th century) <b>basilica.</b> Romanesque in style, the structure has a nave, two aisles, and a high, deep apse. Note the 14th-century crucifixion scene by a student of Giotto. This section has now been transformed into a museum, housing sarcophagi, sculpture, Neapolitan goldsmiths' artwork, and other treasures from the cathedral complex. Steps from the basilica lead down into the <b>Cripta di Sant'Andrea</b> (Crypt of Saint Andrew). The cathedral above was built in the 13th century to house the saint's bones, which came from Constantinople and supposedly exuded a miraculous liquid believers call the \"manna of Saint Andrew.\" Following the one-way traffic up to the cathedral itself, you finally get to admire the elaborate polychrome marbles and painted, coffered ceilings from its 18th-century restoration. Art historians shake their heads over this renovation, as the original decoration of the apse must have been one of the wonders of the Middle Ages.<br /><br /><b>Valle dei Mulini</b><br /><br />Uphill from town, this was for centuries Amalfi's center for papermaking, an ancient trade learned from the Arabs, who learned it from the Chinese. Beginning in the 12th century, former flour mills were converted to produce paper made from cotton and linen. In 1211 Frederick II of Sicily prohibited this lighter, more readable paper for use in the preparation of official documents, favoring traditional sheepskin parchment. But by 1811 more than a dozen mills here, with more along the coast, were humming. Natural waterpower ensured that the handmade paper was cost-effective. Flooding in 1954, however, closed most of the mills for good, and many have been converted into private housing. The <b>Museo della Carta</b> (Museum of Paper) opened in 1971 in a 15th-century mill: paper samples, tools of the trade, old machinery, and the audiovisual presentation are all enlightening. You can also participate in a paper-making laboratory.<br /><br /><b>Santa Maria Maggiore</b><br /><br />As inscribed on a capital at the entrance, one Duke Mansone I had this church constructed in 986. Though the layout is Byzantine, a 16th-century overhaul inverted the entrance and high altar, and the decoration is now mostly baroque. The campanile dates from the 12th century, and there's a noteworthy 18th-century crèche scene. The church is open only for Sunday services.<br /><br /><b>Porta della Marina<br /></b><br />This gateway \"door\" to the harbor bears a huge, flaking ceramic panel, created by Renato Rossi in the 1950s, commemorating the trade routes of the republic during the Middle Ages. In one example, ships loaded with Italian timber sold the wood for gold in North Africa, then used the gold to buy gems, spices, and silks in Asia to trade back in Italy. Walk 200 feet along Corso delle Repubbliche Marinare, past the tourist office, to see the ceramic panel created by Diodoro Cossa in the 1970s. The scenes illustrate local historical highlights, among them Roman refugees establishing themselves in nearby Scala in the 4th century, the founding of Amalfi by these same Romans, Amalfi's commercial and diplomatic role in the Mediterranean, the arrival of St. Andrew's body, and the invention of the maritime compass.<br /><br /><b>Hotel Luna Convento</b><br /><br />The legendary St. Francis of Assisi founded this 13th-century former monastery that retains its original cloister, famous for its distinctive Arab-Sicilian arcaded columns and crypt with frescoes. Two centuries ago the property was transformed into the Amalfi Coast's earliest hotel. The many noteworthy guests include Henrik Ibsen, who wrote much of his play <i>A Doll's House</i> here. The hotel also owns the landmark Torre Saracena (Saracen Tower), now home to a bar and nightspot, which sits across the highway and stands guard over Amalfi's seaside promontory.<br /><br /><b>Maria Santissima Addolorata</b><br /><br />This church is adjacent to the confraternity founded in 1765 to organize Amalfi's Good Friday celebrations. The entrance gate bears a late-Gothic bas-relief of the Crucifixion, once belonging to nobility from the nearby village of Scala and identified by its coat of arms at the foot of the cross. The interior is Neoclassical, with a coffered ceiling and a harmonious scale; note the 16th-century marble Madonna and Child in the sacristy. The church is only open on Saturday evening for 7 pm Mass (6:30 from November to March).<br /><br /><b>Arsenale della Repubblica</b><br /><br />From the middle of the 11th century, Amalfi's center of shipbuilding, custom houses, and warehouses was the Arsenale, today the only (partially) preserved medieval shipyard in southern Italy. Ships and galleys up to 80 feet long, equipped with up to 120 oars, were built at this largest arsenal of any medieval maritime republic. Two large Gothic halls here now host occasional exhibitions and display artifacts from Amalfi's medieval period, including paintings, ancient coins, banners, and jeweled costumes. The highlight is the original 66-chapter draft of the code of the Tavole Amalfitana, the sea laws and customs of the ancient republic, used throughout the Italian Mediterranean from the 13th to the 16th century. The Tavole established everything from prices for boat hires to procedures to be followed in case of a shipwreck. Long one of the treasures of the Imperial Library of Vienna, the draft was returned to Amalfi after more than 500 years. Ten of the arsenal's original 22 stone piers remain; the others were destroyed by storms and changes in the sea level on this ever-active coast.<br /><br /><b>Piazza Flavio Gioia</b><br /><br />A statue, set in an ironically disorienting traffic roundabout in front of the harbor, honors the Amalfitan credited with inventing the maritime compass in 1302. Many say it was the Chinese who invented the compass, passing the idea along to the Arabs, who traded with Amalfi; Gioia may have adapted it for sea use (for the record, some historians believe there was no such person as Gioia).<br /><br /><b>Rua Nova Mercatorum<br /><br /></b>A tunnel-like passageway also known as Via dei Mercanti, the evocative Rua Nova was the main thoroughfare of medieval Amalfi, when the main road was a raging torrent. Still the town's most fascinating \"street,\" it is especially wonderful when the light from alleys and windows plays on its white walls. Stretching almost the length of the main street, it ends at a medieval-era <i>contrada,</i> or neighborhood, with a fountain known as <i>Capo di Ciuccio</i> (donkey's head), where mules would refesh themselves after the climb down from the hills.</p>",
    "short_description": "<p>  </p><p>At first glance, it's hard to imagine that this resort destination was one of the world's great naval powers, and a sturdy rival of Genoa and Pisa for control of the Mediterranean in the 11th and 12th centuries. Once the seat of the Amalfi Maritime Republic, the town is set in a verdant valley of the Lattari Mountains, with cream-colored and pastel-hued buildings tightly packing a gorge on the Bay of Salerno. The harbor, which once launched the greatest fleet in Italy, now bobs with ferries and blue-and-white fishing boats. The main street, lined with shops and <em>pasticcerie,</em> has replaced a raging mountain torrent, and terraced hills flaunt the green and gold of lemon groves. Bearing testimony to its great trade with Tunis, Tripoli, and Algiers, Amalfi remains honeycombed with Arab-Sicilian cloisters and covered passages. In a way Amalfi has become great again, showing off its medieval glory days with sea pageants, convents-turned-hotels, ancient paper mills, covered streets, and its glimmering cathedral.</p>",

    "description": "<p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" align=\"justify\">&nbsp;Alanya is Turkey's hottest resort town—literally. Temperatures here are higher than almost anywhere else in Turkey, averaging 106°F (27°C) in July and August; the waves lapping the long Mediterranean beaches that sweep toward Alanya's great rock citadel are only a degree or two cooler. This makes high summer in Alanya heaven for sun-starved, disco-loving, hard-drinking northern Europeans but rather hellish for anyone seeking a quiet holiday surrounded by nature. That said, Alanya is home to one of Turkey's biggest year-round expatriate communities, and in spring and autumn it's a pleasantly warm and inexpensive place to indulge in a few days of easily accessible swimming, historic sites, and good food. Foreign influence has encouraged this city to clean up its act. Former wastelands of concrete-block apartments are now colorfully painted; Ottoman districts around the harbor are well on the way to being restored; and the eclectic jumble of houses inside the magnificent red-walled citadel contains an increasing number of handsome boutique hotels. Other improvements include the opening of a microbrewery (Red Tower, which serves what may be the best beer in Turkey) and the debut of touch-screen bike rentals around the city center. Alanya is famed for its sandy beaches, within walking distance of most hotels. The best swimming place is known as Cleopatra's Beach—yet another accretion to the fables surrounding Mark Antony's courtship of the Egyptian queen—and its yellow sands extend northwest from the citadel. Boats can be hired from the harbor for relaxing day tours to caves around the citadel and a view of the only surviving Seljuk naval arsenal. Alanya, called Kalanaoros by the Byzantines, was captured by the sultan Alaaddin Keykubad in 1221 and became the Turkish Seljuks' first Mediterranean stronghold in their centuries-long migration westward. Several amusing stories explain the Seljuk sultan's conquest: one says he married the commander's daughter, another that he tied torches to the horns of thousands of goats and drove them up the hill in the dark of night, suggesting a great army was attacking. Most likely, he simply cut a deal. Once settled, he modestly renamed the place Alaiya, after himself, and built defensive walls to ensure he would never be dislodged. The Ottomans arrived in 1471, and gave it its current name, Alanya.<br /><br /><b>Nightlife</b><br /><br />Alanya's nightlife centers around its harbour&nbsp;and the explosive beat on&nbsp;İskele Caddesi—although there are also a few large dance clubs in Dimçay, about 5 km (3 miles) outside town. Bars often have extensive menus, and restaurants frequently have live music or turn into impromptu discos after dinner.<br /><b><br />Dining<br /><br />Özsüt Alanya<br /><br /></b>This modern, air-conditioned cake shop is the best place in town for restoring lagging caffeine or blood sugar levels—perhaps before an assault on the citadel above. It's part of a modern chain that has expanded rapidly through Turkish cities thanks to the excellent cakes, pastries, and sweets. The upstairs area has a nice harbor view.<br /><br /><b>Red Tower Brewery Restaurant</b><b><br /><br /></b>This is one of Turkey's first microbreweries, and the beer here is some of the best you'll find in the country. Choices include a traditional pilsner and dark Marzen ale. Different eateries on each floor serve everything from kebabs to sushi; all overlook the Alanya harbor and Red Tower fortifications. In summer you can dine on the terrace across the road. On the roof is an open-air Skylounge Bar.<br /><br /><b>Filika Restaurant</b><br /><br />This fine restaurant is poised on a pretty terrace right on Cleopatra's Beach, and it looks up to the citadel towering overhead, with enough foliage to make modern Alanya disappear. The dinner menu is heavy on meat (try the lamb with rosemary), but there is also a more basic snack menu at lunch.<br /><br /><b>Güverte Restaurant</b><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">This long-standing favorite promises a delightful view of the harbor and excellent traditional Turkish fare that's focused on fresh seafood. If you're lucky, they'll have <i>grida</i> (grouper) as a daily special; if not, try the fried squid with local <i>tarator</i> sauce—a mixture of yogurt, garlic, lemon, walnuts, olive oil, and bread.<br /><br /></span><b>Flash</b><br /><br />A few blocks north of the fray, Flash attracts more locals than tourists and survives on word of mouth. It's known for soups, steaks, kebabs, and <i>kiremit</i> stew cooked in clay bowls.<br /><br /><b>Nightlife<br /><br />James Dean Bar<br /></b><br />The James Dean Bar is popular and less expensive than some of the other haunts on the strip.<br /><br /><b>Robin Hood Bar<br /></b><br />The Sherwood forest—themed, three-floor Robin Hood Bar is the biggest on the block; it's open year round and tries to cater to all tastes.<br /><b><br />Summer Garden<br /></b><br />Near the seafront on the road to Antalya, this hugely popular club and its sister restaurant <b>Fresco</b> are part of the same sprawling complex. Two large bars among the palm trees have a dance floor cooled with outdoor air-conditioning (really!). Drinks start flowing at 6 pm, and the music doesn't stop until about 4 am. Free transport to/from Alanya is available for groups of five or more.<br /><br /><strong>Sights<br /><br /></strong><b>Kızıl Kule<br /><br /></b>A minor masterpiece of Mediterranean military architecture, the 100-foot-high Kızıl Kule was built by the Seljuks in 1225 to defend Alanya's harbor and the nearby shipyard known as the <b>tersane</b> (arsenal). Sophisticated technology for the time was imported in the form of an architect from Aleppo who was familiar with Crusader castle building. The octagonal redbrick structure includes finely judged angles of fire for archers manning the loopholes, cleverly designed stairs to cut attackers off, and a series of troughs to convey boiling tar and melted lead onto besieging forces. Nowadays the Red Tower's cool passages house temporary exhibits, usually less captivating than the view from the roof. A short walk south along the water—or along the castle walls, if you prefer—is the <b>tersane</b>, which is made up of five workshops, all under an arched roof. Ships could be pulled up under the vaulted stone arches for building or repairs, and the cover was likely also useful for storing war supplies.<br /><b><br />Alanya Müzesi</b><br /><br />It's worth dropping by the small, recently renovated small Alanya Müzesi just to see the perfectly preserved Roman bronze statue of a gleaming, muscular Hercules from the 2nd century AD. There are also two nice mosaics, some interesting stone altars, and limestone ossuaries. Note the Ottoman Greek inscriptions in Karamanli—Turkish written with the Greek alphabet.<br /><br /><b>Kale</b><br /><br />Views of the splendid castle or <i>kale</i>, on a mighty crag surrounded on three sides by the sea, dominate all roads into Alanya. The crenellated outer walls are 7 km (4 miles) long and include 146 towers. The road pierces these outer walls through a modern break, dividing as it heads up the summit. One section leads to the <strong>İç Kale</strong> (inner fortress), the other to the <b>Ehmediye</b>; both have places to park. If you don't have a car, there is a bus to the summit, which allows you to walk up or down through the old city's residential area, starting or ending at the Kızıl Kule—it's a hot trek in summer, though.[]In the center of the castle are the remains of the original <i>bedestan</i> (bazaar); the erstwhile old shops are now rooms in the lackluster Bedestan Hotel. Along a road to the top of the promontory, a third wall and a ticket office defends the <strong>İç Kale (Keep).</strong> Inside are the ruins of a Byzantine church, with some 6th-century frescoes of the evangelists. Keykubad probably also had a palace here, although discoveries by the McGhee Center of Georgetown University—itself housed in a beautiful Ottoman mansion perched on the cliff-face between the first and second ring of walls—indicates that in times of peace the Seljuk elite probably preferred their pleasure gardens and their hunting and equestrian sports on the well-watered plain below. Steps ascend to the battlement on the summit. A viewing platform is built on the spot where condemned prisoners and women convicted of adultery were once cast to their deaths. The ticket is also valid for the <b>Ehmediye</b> area, past the 17th-century Suleymaniye Camii, where a small citadel is built on the foundations of classical walls. Admire the ruined monastery down below but do not attempt to descend toward it—the mountainside is very treacherous.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3>",

    "description": "<p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" align=\"justify\">Sophisticated Antalya is a definite tourist hub, and with a population approaching the 1-million mark, it’s among Turkey's fastest growing cities. These days the international terminals of Antalya airport are busier even than those in Istanbul. Most visitors are on package tours, but Antalya is a popular destination among Turks, too. Enormous hotels east of the city help accommodate them; however, you can bed down in one of the restored mansions or pansiyons found in the atmospheric Kaleiçi quarter and hardly notice the big urban conglomeration all around. On the hilltop above the harbor are tea gardens and bars with views that extend south to the Bey Mountains and north to the Taurus Mountains.<br /><br /><b>Shopping</b><br /><br />The shopping streets here have more variety than anywhere else on the Turquoise Coast, although the merchandise, in general, is the same sort of stuff you find all over Turkey. The less expensive clothing shops and jewelry arcades are concentrated east and north of the old town walls, while the old town itself has more decorative souvenirs. Kenan Evren Boulevard, along the seafront cliffs toward the museum, has the most upmarket clothing shops. A short taxi ride to the west of town is Antalya's fanciest mall, the Migros Shopping Center. Set behind the Su Hotel, it has a large supermarket, eight cinemas, and a large food court, as well as 100 shops that represent both international brands (like Swatch, Lacoste, and Tommy Hilfiger) and Turkey's big clothing chains (including Mavi Jeans, LCW for children's clothes, Derimod for upmarket leathers, Bisse and Abbate for shirts, and Vakkorama and Boyner for general clothing).<br /><br /><b>Arts/Entertainment<br /><br />Atatürk Kulture Merkezi<br /></b><br />Also known as AKM, the Atatürk Kulture Merkezi is a cultural complex with an exhibition space and several theaters located in a cliff-top park about 3 km (2 miles) west of the city center. It hosts concerts year-round—look for fliers posted around the city—as well as an annual film festival.<br /><br /><b>Dining<br /><br /></b><b>Tophane<br /><br /></b>Sitting in this tea garden, looking out to the harbor, sea, and mountains beyond, is one of Antalya's great pleasures. The drinks and snacks are inexpensive, but the views are priceless. It's a good stop on the way to the museum—you can walk or catch the old tram, which leaves from here every half hour.<br /><br /><b>Parlak Restaurant<br /><br /></b>If shopping in the jewelry bazaar opposite the clock tower has tired you out, try this long-time Antalya favorite. The speciality is chicken roasted over charcoal, but there's also a full range of fish, meat, and mezes to choose from. In summer, tables are spread out in front of the restaurant.<br /><br /><b>Club Arma<br /><br /></b>You can't miss this restaurant—it has a spectacular location halfway up the main road from the old harbor with a panoramic view of the Old City and the sea. Inside, airy stone arches give it elegant style despite the fact that this was once the port's petroleum depot. Club Arma is Antalya's most luxurious restaurant, serving octopus carpaccio, lobster, duck, chocolate soufflé, chestnut parfait, and fresh cheesecake, along with a full range of foreign spirits and cigars from a humidor. At 11 pm, the dance club alongside swings into action.<br /><br /><b>Mermerli Restaurant</b><br /><br />At the eastern end of the harbor, the Mermerli has good prices and a broad menu that includes fish, steak, Turkish grills, and all-day breakfasts. But the location is its best asset. A breezy terrace offers excellent views. It's a good place to eat if you want to relax on Mermerli Beach—the bathing spot is just down the steps, and the restaurant controls access.<br /><br /><b>Vanilla<br /><br /></b>If you are kebabed out, this Old City restaurant has some of the best contemporary cuisine on the coast and serves it in an appropriately stylish setting. The menu changes regularly, though it's basically modern European with a touch of Asia and includes items like pork that you don't see too often in Turkey. The owners, English chef Wayne and his Turkish wife Emel, also operate a very cool lounge next door where you can order coffee during the day or cocktails at night.<br /><b><br />St. Paul's Place</b><br /><br />A friendly, clubby retreat on the southern edge of the old city, St. Paul's Place is run by expats and serves great coffee, American cakes, and home-cooked lunches. It also has a library of exchange books and a nice garden. Warm and <br />welcoming to all, this Christian religious center sometimes organizes religion-oriented tours and can give helpful advice on faith-based tourism.<br /><b><br />The Bigman</b><br /><br />Almost opposite the Antalya Museum but hidden a little down the hill towards the sea, this restaurant may well have the best view in town. Owned by an Antalyan former basketball player (aka the Big Man), it's a popular place for locals to come for a special meal. The menu focuses on meat, pasta, pizza, and kebabs. The quality can be hit or miss, but regulars praise the steak and the portions are, well, big.<br /><br /><b>Seraser Fine Dining Restaurant</b><br /><br />With fine food and excellent service, the stylish Seraser aspires to be the best restaurant in all of Turkey. Part of the Tuvana Hotel, it is set in the leafy courtyard of a historic house, with indoor and outdoor dining areas. The menu is conservative European, so don't expect anything Turkish other than the quality ingredients—90% of which are organic. Starters include goat cheese and aubergine soufflé; grouper and chargrilled lamb are popular mains, but do save room for dessert (try the sugarless, flourless truffle cake). With over 300 options, the wine list is equally impressive.<br /><br /><b>Nightlife<br /><br />Castle Café and Bar<br /><br /></b>The perfect start to any evening out in Antalya starts by watching the sun set from the clifftop Castle Café and Bar, next to Hıdırlık Kulesi—you can accompany your drink with some of their sesame-and-garlic dip, known as <i>hibeş.<br /><br /></i><b>Sights<br /></b><b><br />Antalya Müzesi</b><br /><br />The province of Antalya has a rich collection of archaeological sites and their assembled finds means a first-rate collection at the Antalya&nbsp;Müzesi. The star is Perge, statues from which fill gallery after gallery, including one just for the gods, from Aphrodite to Zeus. There are also Turkish crafts, costumes, prehistoric artifacts from the Carian Cave, and preclassical statues from Elmalı,<b> </b>with bits of Byzantine iconography and some prehistoric fossils thrown in. One gallery has several fine Roman sarcophagi from the 2nd century AD, including a wonderful one illustrating the labors of a steadily aging Hercules. Upstairs are several coin hordes; the large one from Elmalı was recently returned to the museum after being smuggled to the U.S. Onsite, you'll also find a good, reasonably-priced cafeteria and gift shop. If you have the time, walk to the museum from the center of town along the clifftop promenade, which has a fine sea view.<br /><br /><b>Yivli Minare<br /><br /></b>Dark blue and turquoise tiles decorate the Yivli Minare, a graceful 13th-century cylinder erected by the Seljuk sultan Alaaddin Keykubat I. The adjoining mosque, named for the sultan, was built on the site of a Byzantine church. Within the complex are two attractive <i>türbes</i> (tombs) and an 18th-century <i>tekke</i> (monastery), which once housed a community of whirling dervishes. The monastery is now used as an unremarkable art gallery. The Nigar Hatun Türbe (Tomb of Lady Nigar), next to the monastery, is a 15th-century copy built in Seljuk style. The <i>medrese</i> (theological school) adjacent to the Fluted Minaret has now been glassed in under a bus-station-style roof and is a tourist-oriented shopping center. It sells standard Turkish fare (think pottery, copperwork, carpets, and tiles) but prices are better than at most other resorts along the coast.<br /><br /><b>Tekeli Mehmet Paşa Cami<br /><br /></b>Behind the clock tower, this mosque was built around 1600 and heavily restored in the 19th century. Commissioned by a wealthy official who was Grand Vizier for only 10 days, it is one of the finest surviving Ottoman mosques in the region.<br /><br /><b>Old Harbor<br /><br /></b>Another way to enter the old city is via the Old Harbor, now filled with yachts, fishing vessels, and tourist-excursion boats. If you're in a car, follow the signs to the <i>yat limañ</i> (harbor) and you'll find a convenient, free parking lot behind the quaysides. From here you can head up any of the lanes leading north and east out of the harbor to get to the heart of the old town. Alternatively wander down from Saat Kulesi, forking to the right past the T-shirt and perfume shops, until you reach the bottom.<br /><br /><b>Suna &amp; Inan Kiraç Müzesi<br /><br /></b>Fifty yards inside Hadrian's gate, turn left for the Suna &amp; Inan Kiraç Museum: a little oasis in a group of restored buildings with an unusual painted exterior that experts say reflects the way most Antalya houses looked in Ottoman times. The museum is part of a privately-funded research institute and has an excellent library (accessible with special permission), plus a shop that sells a good range of guidebooks. The main display area has interesting pictures of Old Antalya and a couple of rooms with waxworks that re-create Ottoman wedding scenes. The best part of the museum is the restored church in the garden, where there is a delightful display of historical kitsch.<br /><br /><b>Saat Kulesi<br /><br /></b>At some point one of the city's Roman towers gained a clock and was dubbed the Saat Kulesi (Clock Tower). Several of the old town's cobbled lanes pass through the wall here. The area, also known as Kalekapısı (Castle Gate), serves as one of the interfaces between the old town and the new.<br /><br /><b>Karaalioğlan Parkı<br /></b><br />Shady Karaalioğlan Parkı is a traditional green space with trees, grass, and benches, as well as a view of the Mediterranean. At the northwest end is a stone tower, called Hıdırlık Külesi, which dates from the 2nd century AD. At sunset, sip a drink at the Castle Café and Bar next door and enjoy an unforgettable panorama of the Bey Mountains.<br /><b><br />Hadrian's Gate<br /><br /></b>One way to enter the old town is via Hadrian's Gate, a short walk from the main Saat Kulesi intersection along pleasant palm-lined Atatürk Caddesi. The gate was constructed in honor of a visit by the Roman emperor in AD 130 and has three arches, each with coffered ceilings decorated with rosettes. Ruts in the marble road show where carts once trundled through. From here a straight Roman road leads through town past Kesik Minare Camii to the Hıdırlık Külesi and the sea.<br /><br /><b>Mermerli Beach</b><br /><br />If you didn't know that Mermerli Beach was there, you'd never guess it. This small strip of sand and pebbles outside the harbor wall is reached via the Mermerli Restaurant, halfway up the hill east of the harbor. The 11 TL admission price to this quiet oasis in the heart of town includes loungers and umbrellas. <br /><b>Amenities</b> : food and drink; showers; toilets; water sports. <b>Best for:</b> swimming.<br /><br /><b>Kesik Minare Camii</b><br /><br />The \"Mosque of the Truncated Minaret\" on Hıdarlık Sokak, a few blocks east of Hadrian's Gate, was once the city's cathedral and dedicated to the Virgin. It was probably built in the 5th century AD and later converted to a mosque. It's usually locked, but you can get a good look from the outside.<br /><br /><b>Konyaaltı Beach</b><br /><br />For many Turks, Antalya is synonymous with the thick crowds of holiday-makers on Konyaaltı Beach, and the packed pebble strand is a hot, somewhat off-putting sight in high season. The city has worked hard to improve the quality of the beach experience, though, with especially impressive results on the 1-km (½-mile) section starting after the museum and ending under the Su Hotel. The beach is largely divided up by concessions, each with its own restaurant, deck chairs, umbrellas, and showers. <br /><b>Amenities</b> : food and drink; parking (no fee); showers; toilets; water sports. <b>Best for:</b> partiers; walking; swimming.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" align=\"justify\"> </p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Times, serif;\"><b>&nbsp;</b></span></p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Times, serif;\"><b>&nbsp;</b></span></p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Times, serif;\"><b>&nbsp;</b></span></p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times, serif;\"><i></i></span>&nbsp;</p>",

    "description": "<b>Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates</b>\n<p>\nThe city of Abu Dhabi is located on the northeastern part of the Persian Gulf in the Arabian Peninsula. It is situated on an island less than 820 feet (250 metres) from the mainland, and joined to the mainland by the Maqta, Mussafah and Sheikh Zayed bridges. Abu Dhabi Island is also connected to Saadiyat Island by a five-lane motorway bridge, and the Al-Mafraq Bridge connects the city to Reem Island. This multi-layer, 27-lane interchange-bridge allows roughly 25,000 automobiles to move per hour. There are three major bridges in the project; the largest has eight lanes, four leaving Abu Dhabi city and four coming in. Most of Abu Dhabi City is located on the island itself, but it has many suburbs on the mainland, including: Khalifa City A, B and C; Al Raha Beach; Al Bahia City A, B and C; Al Shahama; Al Rahba; Between Two Bridges; Baniyas; and Mussafah Residential. \nArchaeological evidence points to civilisations, such as the Umm an-Nar culture, existing in Abu Dhabi as early as the 3rd-millennium B.C. Settlements were also found further outside the modern city of Abu Dhabi, near Al Ain, and around the UAE's second-tallest mountain, Hafeet Mountain, or 'Jebel Hafeet'. The Bani Yas, a large Bedouin tribe, was originally centred on the Liwa Oasis. In 1793, the Al Bu Falah subsection migrated to the island of Abu Dhabi due to the discovery of fresh water there. One family within this section was the Al Nahyan family, which rules Abu Dhabi to this day. A series of 19th-century treaties with Great Britain protected Abu Dhabi from piracy, but the British maintained their influence in Abu Dhabi as a thriving pearling industry waned during the 1930s and interest in the oil potential of the Persian Gulf grew. The discovery of vast oil reserves in the late-1950s and early-1960s prompted the rapid development of the city's economy and infrastructure. In the years since, the city's economy and infrastructure developed rapidly, and changed Abu Dhabi beyond recognition. \nToday, Abu Dhabi is one of the world's richest cities, with wide, tree-lined boulevards, lush green parks, gushing fountains and imposing skyscrapers. Apart from its modern cityscape, Abu Dhabi's most striking feature is its lushness. The municipality has spent a fortune and hired an army of labourers to transform this desert city into a green oasis. Abu Dhabi has over 2,000 well-maintained parks and gardens, and more than 249 miles (400 kilometres) of coastline, of which six miles (10 kilometres) are public beaches. Abu Dhabi has several large green spaces, many of which include play areas and equipment for children, and the city is studded with lovely fountains, swathes of neon light and the occasional sculpture. A small part of the land area is covered by mountains, containing several caves. The coastal area contains pockets of wetland and mangrove colonies. Abu Dhabi also has dozens of islands, mostly small and uninhabited, some of which have been designated as wildlife sanctuaries. \nAbu Dhabi's culture and heritage can be explored during visits to the Al Maqtaa Fort, one of the oldest and major landmarks of Abu Dhabi City. The Hili Archaeological Park features tombs dating from the second-half of the 3rd-millenium B.C., including the important Hili Grand Tomb. At the Al Ain National Museum, explore the ethnographical and archaeological sections, along with an oasis featuring an excellent example of 'falaj', an ancient irrigation system. The Al Hosn Fort, an ancient, renovated fort that was formerly utilised as the official residence of the Sheikh, now serves as the home of the Abu Dhabi Cultural Foundation. At Heritage Village, you can explore the small museum which depicts the daily activities of the Arab community prior to the discovery of oil. Additional historic sites include the Al Ain Palace Museum, Al Ain National Museum, Sir Bani Yas Island Archaeological Site, Muraijib Fort, Al Jahili Fort, Qasr al Hosn Exhibition, Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Library, and Al Maqtaa Fort. \nAbu Dhabi's exquisite inland and desert beauty is the ideal setting for wonderfully scenic and memorable land excursions, including bird-watching, nature walks at the Al Ain Oasis and Heritage Heartland, bicycling, tennis, horseback-riding, caving, exhilarating dune rides in the Al Khatim Desert, exploring the Arabian Wildlife Park and Al Ain Zoo, and golfing at the Saadiyat Beach Golf Club, Abu Dhabi Golf Club or Yas Links Golf Club. Abu Dhabi's crystal-clear coastal waters are ideally-suited for a wide array of popular water sports, including swimming, snorkelling and scuba diving at the Intercontinental Beach Resort and Rotana Beach, and fishing, sea-kayaking, boating, and sailing in the Arabian Gulf. \n</p><p>\n<b>Please Note: </b></p><p>\nAlthough the dress code in the UAE is more relaxed than elsewhere in the Middle East, it is still relatively conservative.

    "short_description": "Just a few decades ago, Abu Dhabi, the island capital of the United Arab Emirates, was a small fishing village with houses made of mud-brick and palm fronds. Today, as a result of revenue from oil, Abu Dhabi is one of the world's richest cities, with wide, tree-lined okulevards, lush green parks, gushing fountains and imposing skyscrapers. Somewhat of a dichotomy, Abu Dhabi is a combination of ultra-modern sophistication and Arab mystique, with friendly and hospitable people offering a warm welcome to visitors. Abu Dhabi's history originated in the 18th century, when, according to legend, a group of tribesmen pursuing a gazelle came upon a freshwater well which they named Abu Dhabi, or \"Father of the Gazelle\". In the 19th century, the first fort was built over this well by a sheikh of the Al-Nahyan dynasty. The fort's name is Al Husn Palace, also known as Old or White Fort, and it is one of the few buildings in Abu Dhabi that is more than 25 years old. Its whitewashed walls are eye-catching amid the backdrop of today's skyscrapers. Presently, it is home to the Cultural Foundation and serves as a documents centre. Abu Dhabi had little significance until the discovery of vast oil reserves in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In the years following, the city's economy and infrastructure developed rapidly and changed Abu Dhabi beyond recognition.",

    "short_description": "Located in the southeast of the French Provence region, Antibes ranks among France’s oldest cities.  Originally named ‘Antipolis’, Antibes was founded by Greek merchants in the 5th century.  The Old City is a maze of small, flower-bedecked streets with Roman and Medieval sections.  A portion of the impressive 16th-century ramparts overlooking the Mediterranean Sea still protect the heart of the Old City.   Antibes is comprised of three distinct sections.  The first is Antibes, which includes the Old City and ramparts.  Next is Juan les Pins, a famous beach resort once praised by Francis Scott Fitzgerald and the site of the annual International Jazz Festival.  Antibes’ third section is Cap d’Antibes, a wooden peninsula that has become a haunt for the rich and famous.  Antibes is also home to Europe’s largest yacht harbor, Port Vauban, where the super-yachts of the wealthy are anchored.   For cruise vessels, Antibes offers an opportunity to visit some of Provence’s prettiest areas.  It also serves as a convenient starting point for trips to the walled-in hilltop village of St. Paul de Vence.   Pier Information The ship is scheduled to anchor in the bay and tender guests ashore. The town centre is within walking distance from the tender pier.  Taxis are not easy to find; therefore, it is recommended that private travel arrangements be planned in advance.  Shopping The Old City offers a wide range of souvenir shops, home decoration, antiques and Provencal artifacts.  Postcards are easily found, and must be sent with French postage stamps.  Most shops, however, do close between 12:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. The local currency is the euro.  Cuisine The cuisine in the southeastern part of France is considered to be varied and healthy, thanks to the common use of quality fresh products and olive oil.  Fresh local fish caught daily, excellent vegetable stew, or  ratatouille , and great local wines highlight the wide range of gastronomical delights that can be found here.  In addition, restaurants in the harbor area typically offer the chef’s daily special, or  plat du jour , on their menus.  Other Sites Antibes primarily serves as a starting point for trips into the surrounding areas, which are included in the organized excursions.  An early-morning stroll through the local fruit and vegetable market may also be of interest.    Private Arrangements For those guests interested in touring at their leisure, we are pleased to offer  .Silver Shore Privato  - both half-day and full-day private arrangements by private car or van.  This program may be booked in advance at silversea.com or purchased on board the ship, subject to availability.  Other private arrangements for independent sightseeing may be requested through the Tour Office on board the ship.",

    "description": "<span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000000;\"></span><p>Australians think of Adelaide as a city of churches, but Adelaide has outgrown its reputation as a sleepy country town dotted with cathedrals and spires. The Adelaide of this millennium is infinitely more complex, with a large, multiethnic population and thriving urban art and music scenes supported by a \"space activation program\" that encourages pop-up shops, markets, performances, street food, mini festivals, art exhibitions, and other \"off-the-cuff\" experiences in the cities underutilized streets and public spaces. Bright and clean, leafy and beautiful Adelaide is a breeze to explore, with a grid pattern of streets encircled by parkland. The heart of the greenbelt is divided by the meandering River Torrens, which passes the Festival Centre in its prettiest stretch.<br /><br /><b>Dining</b><br /><br />Melbourne, Gouger, O'Connell, and Rundle streets, along with the Norwood Parade and Glenelg neighborhoods, are the main eating strips. In any of these areas it's fun to stroll around until a restaurant or café takes your fancy. Chinatown is also lively, and if you feel like an alfresco picnic, pick some delicious local produce from Central Market.<br /><br /><b>Jolleys Boathouse</b></p><p>Blue canvas directors' chairs and white-clothed wooden  tables create a relaxed, nautical air here–which perfectly suits the location  on the south bank of the River Torrens. Sliding glass doors open onto a  full-width front balcony for alfresco dining. The imaginative modern Australian  menu changes seasonally, but might include a salad of grilled Kangaroo Island  marron, green mango, basil and shallots, or sweet pork belly with red dates.  Executives make up most lunch crowds, and warm evenings attract couples. <br /><b><br />Paul's Seafood on Gouger</b></p><p class=\"inline\">It may look like your run-of-the-mill chippie, but this Gouger Street veteran of more than 60 years is the place to get hooked on King George whiting. It's been hailed as one of Adelaide's best—and best-priced—seafood restaurants. The salt-and-pepper squid is another local favourite. For a great view of the bustle in the open kitchen, request a table upstairs on the ship's-deck-like mezzanine floor.<br /><br /><b>Market Plaza Food Court</b></p><p>This bustling pan-Asian food hall is a  beef-with-black-bean-sauce–free zone. Instead, stalls including Mum's Kimbap  and Li's Mouth Magic produce such dishes as salty fish and chicken fried rice,  special hot pot, and <i>pho ga </i> (Vietnamese chicken-noodle soup with fresh  mint and coriander). Shoppers and tourists crowd the fake-marble tables next  door to the Central Market, yet you never have to wait more than a few minutes  for a delicious, cheap meal.<br /><br /><b>Amalfi Pizzeria Ristorante</b></p><p>This place is rustic and noisy. If it weren't  for the Australian accents here, you'd swear you were in a regional Italian  eatery. The terrazzo-tile dining room is furnished with bare wooden tables,  around which sit professionals and university students in enthusiastic  conversation. The paper place-mat menu lists traditional pizza and pasta dishes  in two sizes—appetizer and entrée—a must-order is the spaghetti marinara.  As this is one of the most popular (read: packed) restaurants in the East End of  Rundle St, reservations are a good idea. Because the restaurant stays open late,  it's also popular after a show or a movie.<br /><b><br />Sammy's on the Marina<br /><br /></b>Enormous fishbowl windows frame views of  million-dollar yachts at this restaurant—one of Adelaide's top seafood  eateries—at the far end of Glenelg's glitzy Holdfast Marina. Watch the setting  sun silhouette playing dolphins or a storm rolling across Gulf St. Vincent as  you tuck into skewered scallops or crispy-skin Atlantic salmon wrapped in  prosciutto and served over brocolini and baby carrots with salsa verde. The menu  here charts South Australia's ocean bounty, and the hot seafood platter (for two  people) would feed a school of sharks.<br /><br /><b>Red Ochre<br /><br /></b>A sweeping view of Adelaide is the backdrop for contemporary  workings of traditional bush meats, herbs, and fruits at this riverfront  restaurant. The downstairs River Café, the restaurant's sister venue, is more  informal, and offers a modern Italian menu for lunch weekdays, while Red Ochre  is only open for dinner. For a splurge, head upstairs; if you like your steaks,  you'll love their Premium steaks served with onion puree and brocolini, bush  tomato chimmichurri, wattle-seeded mustard, pepper berry jam, and confit garlic.  Don't miss the wattle-seed pavlova, Red Ochre's version of Australia's famous  meringue dessert.<br /><br /><b>Big Table<br /><br /></b>Simply the best breakfast choice in Adelaide, Big Table has  been at the Central Market for over 15 years, and regulars know to get there  early for a chance at one of the few tables. Sitting up at the counter isn't too  bad an option, however, especially when you have treats like fresh banana bread  with rhubarb conserve and ricotta to look forward to. The enormous Big Brekkie  lives up to its name, and offers quality as well as quantity with delicious  thick-sliced local bacon and field mushrooms cooked with pesto and served on Turkish  bread.<br /><br /><b>Goodlife Modern Organic Pizzas</b></p><p>Forget about greasy pepperoni-loaded  pizzas—the pies at this local trend-setting favorite are as different from the  norm as you can get. It was the country's first pizzeria to be certified as  organic, and the innovative toppings like kapunda free-range chicken are as  tasty as they sound, especially with a glass of their well-priced local wine.  The dessert pizzas are worth a try if you're not carb-ed out. You'll also find a  Goodlife Pizza in Glenelg and North Adelaide.<br /><br /><b>Cibo Espresso</b></p><p>Caffeine addicts head here for a little taste of Italy in  stylish fun surroundings. The small local chain has branches dotted around the  city, and in each one you are guaranteed a fabulous espresso from their Wega  machines and irresistible sweet treats. If you're there at lunchtime, the  freshly baked panini are good, too. All branches have free Wi-Fi.<br /><br /><b>The Brasserie<br /><br /></b>Chef Simon Bryant has become somewhat of a local  celebrity, having appeared on a national weekly TV program. Although his  restaurant has a lively and relaxed atmosphere, Bryant is renowned for his  insistence on top-quality local produce. The menu from the open kitchen changes  every season, but always makes use of local specialties from the Fleurieu  Peninsula, Kangaroo Island, and the local Central Markets around the corner. If  Australia's national animal is on the menu, give it a try here.<br /><br /><b>Mesa Lunga<br /><br /></b>This Tapas-inspired restaurant and adjacent bar is packed to  the rafters most nights of the week. Head to the bar for the perfect ambience  for enjoying smaller plates of delicious fine-sliced meats, white anchovies or  confit potato-and-onion Spanish omelet. Opt to be seated at a table with  comfortable leather chairs for a more hearty option such as marsala braised Ox  tail and cheek, celeriac puree, and heirloom carrots and jus. There's a shared  wall with the neighboring Sangria bar, which is also popular, especially for the  wide variety of sangria cocktails on offer. <br /><br /><b>Concubine</b></p><p>This restaurant, located in Adelaide's premier Asian dining  strip, features a fusion of modern Chinese dishes with traditional spices and  fresh local produce. The food here is sensational; the wine and cocktail lists  are intriguing; the service is flawless and friendly; and the ambience is second  to none thanks to the funky decor and trendy vibe. The tangy tamarind duck keeps  the customers coming back and the serving sizes on a full order of appetizers  and entrées could be a challenge, albeit one to be relished, even without  dessert.<br /><b><br />The Store Bistro<br /><br /></b>Even after a recent refurbishment to give the place a  French bistro vibe, North Adelaide yuppies mix with people from all walks of  life to fuel up on aromatic coffee, freshly-made smoothies, wine, beer, cider,  and some of Adelaide's most fabulous food. Grab a table and order at the  bar—try the Balsamic Portobello Mushrooms with rocket, oregano, and goat curd  on rye for breakfast. More substantial meals are available in the afternoon.  Weekend crowds mean slow service, so try to score a sidewalk table where you can  kick back and watch the comings and goings of the neighborhood.<br /><b><br />Kenji Modern Japanese Restaurant</b></p><p>Kenji, the chef and owner, is one of  the few in Australia to hold a license to prepare fugu (pufferfish), so it goes  without saying this should be first on your list—you'll experience a great  amalgamation of taste, texture, and presentation. Other famous dishes include  the extremely fresh sushi and sashimi boat (oysters, sushi, sashimi, pickled  fish, etc.), which serves 2—3 people for a pricey A$65. The quality of the  food is worth the price, though, and the ever-changing degustation menu is  genius; plus, the miso-marinated olives are complimentary.<br /><b><br />Chianti Classico<br /><br /></b>Family-run since 1985, Chianti Classico is all things  to all people. Breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Big or small groups. Inside or  outside dining. You can expect exquisite service and that host Maria Favaro will  make every guest feel like the center of attention. Families mix with business  people in the mornings for the award-winning breakfasts while the food  connoisseurs show up in the evenings. The northern Italian cuisine is  highlighted by the Genovese-style stuffed veal breast and the tagliolini with  local blue swimmer crab and chilli. But if it's a signature dish you're after,  try the sumptuous slow-roasted rabbit with pancetta, port, and sage.<br /><br /><b>United Latino Cocina<br /><br /></b>Long communal tables, funky artwork, and Mexican  tunes typify this tucked-away little restauraunt along the side of the new  Rundle Place development. Stylishly modern with Mexican slant, United Latino  Cocina (known locally as ULC) is rapidly gaining momentum. The menu isn't long,  but there is a nice variety that ranges from quesadillas and tacos to chicken  wings and less traditional items such as loose-leaf green tea. Daily specials  are always on offer and can be hard to look past, but the tostadas are well  known, as are the fish taco and the ULC Dog—a chorizo sausage nestled in  creamy jalapeño coleslaw, bean mash, cheese, and onion strings.<br /><br /><b>Nordburger<br /><br /></b>Good burgers are taking over Adelaide, but you won't find too  many better than those at Nordburger. Just a five-minute drive from the center  of town, you'll find queues out the door—everyone's looking to catch a glimpse  of Masterchef contestant and owner Michael Wheldon—of people waiting to sink  their teeth into the signature American style cheeseburgers and hot dogs. The  staff is friendly, service is fast, and people sit at the counter or eat  standing up by tall tables in the back, which combines for quick turnover. Be  sure to try the PB&amp;J Milkshake!<br /><br /><b>Jasmin Indian Restaurant<br /><br /></b>Located in a basement off Hindmarsh Square,  this elegant establishment is beautifully decorated with stylish timber  furniture and local artwork. The dim lighting and relaxing background music  really sets the mood for some quality Indian cuisine, which is what you'll get  in spades—visiting Indian and English cricket teams dine here and you know  those guys know a thing or two about good Indian food. You might want to try  everything on the menu, and the Feed Me Menu allows for just that, but the  Punjabi tandoori lamb and prawn sambal are considered perennial favorites. The  staff are friendly and the service is exceptional.<br /><br /><b>COS<br /><br /></b>If you're in need of a fine steak, look no further. Located on  trendy Leigh Street, Cos is one of Adelaide's best spots for steak and seafood.  The simplicity of these steaks—select from a 250-gram grain-fed yearling  eye-fillet to a 500-gram rib-eye fillet—served with frites and side salad  ensure even lunchers are not too gastronomically challenged. An excellent  selection of local and international boutique wines rounds out a complete meal.  If seafood is your fancy, there are some excellent oyster options, not to  mention signature dishes featuring king prawns, rock lobster, and King George  whiting.<br /><br /><b>Hotels<br /><br /></b>At first glance, large international, business-style hotels seem to dominate Adelaide—there's a Hilton, a Hyatt, a Sebel, and a Crowne Plaza—but there's actually a wide choice of places to rest your head. Adelaide's accommodations are a mix of traditional mid-rise hotels, backpacker hostels, an abundance of self-contained apartments, and charming bed-and-breakfasts, many in century-old sandstone buildings. With a car you'll be within easy reach of a Glenelg beach house or an Adelaide Hills B&amp;B.<br /><b><br />Nightlife</b><br /><br />There's something going on every evening in Adelaide, although clubs are especially packed on weekends. Cover charges vary according to the night and time of entry. Nightlife for the coming week is listed in \"Adelaide (Scene),\" a pull-out section of Thursday's edition of the <i>Advertiser. Rip It Up</i> is a free Thursday music-and-club publication aimed at the younger market. <i>Onion,</i> published fortnightly on Thursday, is Adelaide's top dance music magazine. <i>dB,</i> a twice-monthly free independent publication, covers music, arts, film, games, and dance.<br /><br />Bars along Rundle Street, the west end of Hindley Street, and Gouger Street are trendy, while Hindley and Waymouth streets are lined with traditional pubs. North Adelaide's O'Connell Street buzzes every night, and the popular Sunday-evening beer-and-banter sessions really pack in the crowds. There are also a number of vibrant pubs on The Parade at Norwood and the Glenelg precinct, especially popular on a Sunday afternoon in the sun.<br /><strong><br />SkyCity<br /><br /></strong>Head to SkyCity for big-time casino gaming, including the highly  animated Australian Two-up, in which you bet against the house on the fall of  two coins. Five bars, including the stylish venue Loco, and three restaurants  are also within the complex. It's one of a handful of places in Adelaide that  keep pumping until dawn.<br /><br /><b>Austral Hotel<br /><br /></b>The first bar in South Australia to put Coopers beer on  tap, the Austral is a local favorite and a great place to drink outdoors. You  can down shooters or sip cocktails from a long list while listening to a band  play or a DJ spin groovy tunes. It's open daily 11 am—3 am.<br /><br /><b>Botanic Bar</b></p><p>This cool city lounge features cordovan banquettes that  encircle the U-shaped, marble-top bar. Muddlers (crushed ice drinks) are the  specialty, and bring in mostly young professionals, including off-duty medics  from the nearby hospital. Celebrated Thai chef Nu Suandokmai recently returned  home after years in Sydney to transform the restaurant menu, which now focuses  on Thai street food. Botanic Bar is open until the wee hours Tuesday to Sunday.<br /><br /><b>Grace Emily</b><br /><br />You'll find bartenders spouting the mantra \"No pokies, no  TAB, no food—pokies are the poker machines found in many pubs, and TAB,  Australia's version of OTB, lets you place bets on horse races—at this  multilevel music-lover's pub. Instead, there's live music nightly, and a pool  table. The beer garden is one of the city's best, with secluded spots for those  wanting a quiet tipple and big round tables for groups to drink en masse and  alfresco. It's open daily 4 pm—late.<br /><br /><b>The Gov<br /><br /></b>The favorite venue of a mixed crowd, young homeowners and  long-term regulars come for Irish music sessions, all-weekend metal fests, and  everything in between. Cabaret, comedy, Latin music—if you can name it, you  can probably hear it here. There's good pub grub, too. It's open weekdays 11 am  to late and Saturday noon to late. It's closed Sunday unless there is a show.<br /><b><br />Wellington Hotel<br /><br /></b>First licensed in 1851, the Wellington is a hops  lovers' heaven, with 32 Australian-brewed beers on tap. Line up six \"pony\"  (sample) glasses on a taster tray, then enjoy a schooner (large glass) of your  favorite.<br /><br /><b>Supermild<br /><br /></b>The cavernous Supermild has a retro feel and is as  unpretentious as they come, which fits in perfectly with the local nightlife  scene. Grab a comfy sofa and chill out with a bunch of friends while listening  to the local DJs doing their thing—either indie, retro, or funk, depending on  the night.<br /><b><br />The Wheatsheaf Hotel</b></p><p>South Australia is well known for its wine, but  microbrewed, craft beer is rapidly forging its own reputation. At The Wheatsheaf  you'll find the best of both worlds with a massive list of boutique wine and  beer from all over the world. To top it off, whiskey is also given the rock star  treatment. \"The Wheaty\" is also a live music venue that features an eclectic mix  of acts from jazz-ska, nu-folk, alt-country, roots, rockabilly and string  quartets every night of the week. This is also a \"Pokie Free\" pub meaning you  won't find a pokie machine (slot machine) in sight. Welcoming to all, the Wheaty  is ultra-hip without being pretentious leaving all labels and egos—at the  door.<br /><br /><b>Udaberri</b><br /><br />One of the first of Adelaide's growing trend of \"small bars,\"  Udaberri is a cozy, intimate setting where some of the city's best wine and beer  is served. The narrow space is reminiscent of a barn, but it's a very chic barn.  DJs spin their groovy house beats but the music is never overpowering as  interaction and conversation is encouraged. If you're lucky enough to beat the  crowds to the loft, you can unwind on the sofas while enjoying the view and  snacking on Basque-style tapas.<br /><br /><b>Casablabla</b><br /><br />You'll find this multicultural tapas and lounge bar along  trendy Leigh Street, the first of Adelaide's laneways to be rejuvenated. The  atmosphere and live entertainment line up is as unique as the contemporary  fusion of South East Asian and Middle Eastern decor—Wednesday night is live  Flamenco night! Head here for a mild-mannered restaurant by day or a pumping  club by night.<br /><br /><b>Clever Little Tailor</b></p><p>Adelaide has a newfound fascination with small bars  and hole-in-the-wall-style venues, and the Clever Little Tailor was one of the  city's first. Named after a German fairy tale, the warmth of this place is  undeniable. The bar staff is welcoming and helpful and the venue is cozy and  charming with its contemporary interior, exposed red bricks, and hanging ferns.  The cocktails are delicious too, and the boutique wine and beer list is  impressive. Plus, the music is soft enough to chat to your hearts' content.<br /><b><br />Jack Ruby<br /><br /></b>Underground, convivial, and very lively, this speakeasy meets  Mississippi juke joint also has a hint of American diner thanks to the awesome  Americana menu. This spot is named after the man who shot Lee Harvey Oswald.  Co-owners Aaron Sandow, chef Sam Worrall-Thompson, and Gareth Lewis traveled the  world to get the vibe just right, and it shows. Craft beer from the U.S. and  Australia dominate the drinks menu, but if beer isn't your thing, try the spiked  milk shakes or the various cocktails on offer.<br /><br /><b>The Grace Establishment</b></p><p>This place is part bar, part restaurant, and  part beer garden. At night things get lively and you'll see your fair share of  hipsters, posh locals, and the manicured set. The food's good, too—they make  their own salted caramel chocolate bar and DIY donuts allow diners to inject the  jam inside the donuts using a syringe.<br /><br /><b>The Loft Oyster &amp; Wine Bar</b><br /><br />Perched above Gouger Street, The Loft is  an eye-catching space that features a beautiful barrel vault ceiling and a  stunning mix of dim lighting, heritage fixtures, and modern decor. Oysters come  in multiple styles, matched with an international wine list including some hard  to find Australian gems. Cocktails here are inspired by recent trends in movies  and TV and add to the feeling of being transported back to the 1920s.<br /><br /><b>Rhino Room</b><br /><br />Want to tickle your funny bone and grab a drink? This the  home of Adelaide comedy, featuring live shows every Monday, Thursday, and Friday  evenings. Some of Australia's best comedians as well as overseas acts grace the  tiny stage; during the annual Fringe Festival you can catch a glimpse of some  verified superstars. But it's also a funky little club in its own right, as art  spills into the space from the attached Urban Cow Studio art gallery and live  music and DJs fill the void when the laughs take a break on other nights.<br /><b><br />The Curious Squire<br /></b><br />In the yuppy end of town, the beer here is the great  leveler. Here you can taste freshly brewed beer from the local Australian James  Squire range, which is brewed on premise, or enroll in the one-hour  Brewniversity courses that are held every Tuesday to get an insight into brewing  process. There are a few curveballs thrown in when it comes to cocktails and the  wine list is good albeit short—after all, this is a brewpub. The menu is full  of pub snacks and bar food with the \"curious\" menu displayed above the bar on  the huge cinema-style marquee. The \"curious\" dishes vary depending on the mood  of the staff but the lasagne pizza seems a perennial favorite.<br /><br /><strong>Art/Entertainment</strong></p><p><strong>BASS Ticket Agency<br /><br /></strong>This agency sells tickets for most live performances.<br /><br /><b>Adelaide Festival Centre</b></p><p>This the city's major venue for the performing arts. The State Opera, the State Theatre Company of South Australia, and the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra perform here regularly.

The box office is open Monday–Saturday 9–6.<br /><b><br />WOMADelaide Festival<br /><br /></b><b>Adelaide Entertainment Centre</b></p><p>Opened in 1991, most major concerts are held here but it also features a mix of everything from music, theater, and other performing arts to conventions and sporting events.<br /><br /><b>Adelaide Fringe Festival<br /><br /></b>The Fringe Festival, held over four weeks during February and March, is the second largest of its kind in the world. It's an open-access arts festival, which means it features cabaret, street performances, comedy, circus, music, visual art, theater, puppetry, dance, and design all over Adelaide and its surroundings. You'll find the carnival-like epicenter of the Fringe in The Garden of Unearthly Delights located in Rundle Park on the eastern side of the city.<br /><br /><b>Adelaide Festival of Arts<br /><br /></b>Australia's oldest arts festival takes place annually for three-weeks in February and March. It's a cultural smorgasbord of outdoor opera, classical music, jazz, art exhibitions, film, a writer's festival, and cabaret presented by some of the world's top artists; it's held across the city at a variety of venues.<br /><br /><strong>Shopping<br /><br /></strong>If you are wondering where everyone in Adelaide is, you'll find them at Rundle Mall, the city's main shopping strip. Shops in the City Center are generally open Monday–Thursday 9–5:30, Friday 9–9, Saturday 9–5:30, and Sunday 11–5. Suburban shops are often open until 9 pm on Thursday night instead of Friday. As the center of the world's opal industry, Adelaide has many opal shops, which are around King William Street. Other good buys are South Australian regional wines, crafts, and Aboriginal artwork. The trendiest area to browse is King William Road in Hyde Park, a 20-minute walk south from Victoria Square. Outside of the city, the Marion Shopping Centre is packed with current trends, and Harbour Town next to Adelaide Airport is a great place to find a bargain.<br /><br /><strong>Australian Opal and Diamond Collection</strong><br /><br />One of Australia's leading Opal merchants, wholesalers, exporters and manufacturing jewellers, Australian Opal and Diamond Collection sells superb handcrafted one-of-a-kind opal jewelry.<br /><br /><b>Adelaide Exchange Jewellers</b><br /><br />Located just off Rundle Mall, the exchange sells high-quality antique jewelry. They can also be found in Glenelg and Modbury.<br /><b><br />Rundle Mall</b></p><p>Adelaide's main shopping area is Rundle Mall, a pedestrian plaza lined with boutiques, department stores—including Australia's two best known stores, Myer and David Jones—and arcades. Heritage-listed Adelaide Arcade is a Victorian-era jewel, with a decorative tiled floor, skylights, and dozens of shops behind huge timber-framed windows. As of this writing, the mall is receiving a major upgrade, but shoppers can still visit the vast array of retail outlets. Once complete, Rundle Mall will be a world-class shopping plaza and host to some of the world's biggest and most elite brands sprinkled amongst the local flavor.<br /><br /><b>Central Market<br /></b><br />One of the largest produce markets in the southern hemisphere, and Adelaide's pride and joy, the Central Market is chock-full of stellar local foods, including glistening-fresh fish, meat, crusty Vietnamese and Continental breads, German baked goods, cheeses of every shape and color, and old-fashioned lollies (candy). You can also buy souvenir T-shirts, CDs, books, cut flowers, and a great cup of coffee. The enthusiastic couple behind Adelaide's Top Food and Wine Tours (www.topfoodandwinetours.com.au) showcase Adelaide's food-and-wine lifestyle—as in the behind-the-scenes guided tour of the Central Market (A$80), which lets you meet stall holders, share their knowledge, and taste the wares. Tours are scheduled Tuesday and Thursday—Saturday at 9:30 am; reservations are essential.<br /><br /><b>Haigh's Chocolates<br /><br /></b>Australia's oldest chocolate manufacturer, has tempted people with corner shop displays since 1915.

You'll find Morrissey, JAG, Levi's, Esprit, Cue, Authentic Factory Outlet (Converse), and Woolworths among the 100 outlets.<br /><br /><b>Sights<br /><br />Art Gallery of South Australia</b></p><p>Many famous Australian painters, including Charles Conder, Margaret Preston, Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri, Russell Drysdale, and Sidney Nolan, are represented in here. Extensive Renaissance and British artworks are on display, and the atrium houses Aboriginal pieces. There is usually a visiting exhibition, too. A café and bookshop are also on-site.<br /><br /><b>Ayers House</b><br /><br />Between 1855 and 1897 this sprawling colonial structure was the home of Sir Henry Ayers, South Australia's premier and the man for whom Uluru was originally named Ayers Rock. Most rooms—including the unusual Summer Sitting Room, in the cool of the basement—have been restored with period furnishings, and the state's best examples of 19th-century costumes are sometimes displayed in changing exhibitions. <br /><br /><b>Botanic Gardens of Adelaide</b><br /><br />These magnificent formal gardens include an international rose garden, giant water lilies, an avenue of Moreton Bay fig trees, acres of green lawns, and duck ponds. The Bicentennial Conservatory—the largest single-span glass house in the southern hemisphere—provides an environment for lowland rain-forest species such as the cassowary palm and torch ginger. Daily free guided tours leave from the Schomburgk Pavilion at 10:30. On weekends there's often a wedding ceremony taking place somewhere on the grounds. In summer the Moonlight Cinema series (<i>www.moonlight.com.au</i>) screens new, classic, and cult films inside the garden at sunset; bring a picnic blanket and a bottle of wine. Tickets sell fast, so plan ahead.<br /><br /><b>Migration Museum</b><br /><br />Chronicled in this converted 19th-century Destitute Asylum, which later in the 19th century served as a school where Aboriginal children were forced to train as servants to the British, are the origins, hopes, and fates of some of the millions of immigrants who settled in Australia during the past two centuries. The museum is starkly realistic, and the bleak welcome that awaited many migrants is graphically illustrated.<br /><br /><b>South Australian Museum</b><br /><br />This museum's Australian Aboriginal Cultures Gallery—the world's largest—houses 3,000 items, including ceremonial dress and paintings from the Pacific Islands. Old black-and-white films show traditional dancing, and touch screens convey desert life. Also in the museum are an exhibit commemorating renowned Antarctic explorer Sir Douglas Mawson, after whom Australia's main Antarctic research station is named; a Fossil Gallery housing the fantastic opalised partial skeleton of a 19-foot-long plesiosaur; and a biodiversity gallery. There's also a café overlooking a grassy lawn. If you are traveling during local school holidays, there are fantastic interactive craft and education activities for children for a small fee.<br /><br /><b>Tandanya Aboriginal Cultural Institute<br /><br /></b>A must-see, Tandanya is the first major Aboriginal cultural facility of its kind in Australia. You'll find high-quality changing exhibitions of works by Aboriginal artists and a theater where you can watch didgeridoo performances (Tuesday to Friday at noon) and shows from Pacific Islanders at the same times at the weekend. There's a great gift shop, too, where you can buy CDs of local music.</p><h4>Adelaide Town Hall</h4><p>An imposing building constructed in 1863 in Renaissance style, the Town Hall was modeled after buildings in Genoa and Florence. Tours visit the Colonel Light Room, where objects used to map and plan Adelaide are exhibited, and there are frequently traveling art exhibitions. The balcony of the Town Hall is famous for the appearance of the Beatles in 1964, which attracted the venue's largest crowd to date: approximately 300,000 screaming fans. <br /><br /><b>Adelaide Zoo</b><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Australia's second-oldest zoo still retains much of its original architecture. Enter through the 1883 cast-iron gates to see such animals as the giant Pandas, Sumatran tigers, Australian rain-forest birds, and chimpanzees housed in modern, natural settings. The zoo is world renowned for its captive breeding and release programs, and rare species including the red panda and South Australia's own yellow-footed rock wallaby are among its successes. In June 2008, the Australian government and Adelaide zoo signed a cooperative agreement to help secure the long-term survival of the giant panda, and in late 2009 Wang Wang and Funi arrived on loan from China to become the only giant pandas in the Southern Hemisphere, and the first to live permanently in Australia. <br /><br /></span><b>National Railway Museum</b><br /><br />Steam-train buffs will love this collection of locomotives and rolling stock in the former Port Adelaide railway yard. The largest of its kind in Australia, the collection includes enormous \"mountain\"-class engines and the \"Tea and Sugar\" train, once the lifeline for camps scattered across the deserts of South and Western Australia. Great for the family, train rides operate daily during local school holidays and on weekends. <br /><b><br />South Australian Maritime Museum<br /><br /></b>Inside a restored stone warehouse, this museum brings maritime history vividly to life with ships' figureheads, shipwreck relics, and intricate scale models. In the basement you can lie in a bunk bed aboard an 1840s immigrant ship and hear passengers telling of life and death on their journeys to South Australia. In addition to the warehouse displays, the museum includes a lighthouse (worth climbing the 75 steps up to see the view), restored steam tug, and a WWII tender at the nearby wharf.<br /><br /><b>St. Francis Xavier's Cathedral<br /><br /></b>This church faced a bitter battle over construction after the 1848 decision to build a Catholic cathedral. It's now a prominent, decorative church with a soaring nave, stone arches through to side aisles with dark-wood ceilings, and beautiful stained-glass windows.<br /><b><br />National Wine Centre of Australia<br /><br /></b>Timber, steel, and glass evoke the ribs of a huge wine barrel, and a soaring, open-plan concourse make this a spectacular showcase for Australian wines set in the Botanic Gardens. The Wine Discovery Journey takes you from neolithic pottery jars to a stainless-steel tank; you can even make your own virtual wine on a touch-screen computer. Some of the best vintages from more than 20 Australian wine-growing regions are also available for tasting at the Concourse Café (which offers a fantastic menu) from A$5.<br /><br /><b>Parliament House</b></p><p>Ten Corinthian columns are the most striking features of this classical parliament building. It was completed in two stages 50 years apart: the west wing in 1889 and the east wing in 1939. Alongside is <b>Old Parliament House,</b> which dates from 1843. There's a free guided tour of both houses weekdays at 10 and 2 during non-sitting days, and on Monday and Friday only when parliament is in session. The viewing gallery is open to the public when parliament is sitting.<br /><br /><b>St. Peter's Cathedral</b></p><p>The spires and towers of this cathedral dramatically contrast with the nearby city skyline. St. Peter's is the epitome of Anglican architecture in Australia, and an important example of grand Gothic Revival. <br /><br /><b>Penfolds Magill Estate<br /><br /></b>Founded in 1844 by immigrant English doctor Christopher Rawson Penfold, this is the birthplace of Australia's most famous wine, Penfolds Grange, and one of the world's only city wineries. Introduced in 1951, Grange is the flagship of a huge stable of wines priced from everyday to special-occasion (collectors pay thousands of dollars to complete sets of Grange). <br /><br /><strong>The Beachhouse<br /><br /></strong>This local entertainment complex, located on the Glenelg foreshore overlooking Holdfast Bay, is fun for children of all ages. There are waterslides, bumper cars, bumper boats, arcade games, minigolf, a miniature train (that children under 35 inches can ride), a modest Ferris wheel, and a <span id=\"dx_temp_1432045079796_9\"></span>carousel serving vistors <span id=\"dx_temp_1432045079797_10\"></span>to Glenelg for more than 120 years. Admission is free but Fun Cards are used to purchase credits for use on the amusements.<br /><br /><strong>Glenelg Beach<br /><br /></strong>Located just 10 (6miles) from the Adelaide city center, Glenelg is a charming beachside suburb known for its sandy beach, historic jetty, serene marinas, bustling shops, hotels, restaurants, bars and the Beachhouse entertainment complex. Trams lead the way to the beach carrying passengers along Jetty Road from the city while pedestrians weave in and out of the various retail outlets that line the strip. A day trip to Glenelg is a must, but this seaside resort setting offers plenty of options for backpackers to see large crowds on hotter days and depending on the season, seaweed can be a problem.<br /><strong>Amenities : </strong>parking, toilets, lifeguards, showers, food and drink, water sports. <strong>Best for : </strong> swimming, sunrise, sunset, windsurfing, walking.<br /><br /><strong>Henley Beach<br /><br /></strong>The beach in this quiet coastal suburb offers whiter sand, gently lapping waves, summer entertainment, and a square known for popular dining spots. You'll find families spread out along the sand, and there are places on the grassy areas to enjoy picnics. The jetty is perfect for walking or fishing—drop a line in the water and try your luck. During summer, Hneley Beach Square bordering the center of the beach itself comes alive with live music and festivals while eateries along Henley Beach Road bring the world to your plate—Asian, African, Mediterranean, and Indian mix with local cuisine.<br /><strong>Amenities : </strong> food and drink, parking, toilets. <strong>Best for : </strong> swimming, sunrise, sunset, walking, windsurfing.<br /><br /><b>Cooper Brewery<br /><br /></b>Founded by Thomas Cooper in 1862, this is Australia's only large-scale, family-owned brewery. The Coopers beer story began when Thomas tried to create a tonic for his ailing wife, Ann, but instead created his first batch of beer. Customers grew in numbers as Thomas hand-delivered his all natural ales and stout by horse and cart; the tradition lives on with guest appearances at special events by Clydesdayles drawing the very same cart that Thomas once used. You can take guided tours (A$22) of the brewhouse and enjoy tastings of the award-winning signature Coopers ales, including Pale Ale, Coopers Sparkling Ale, and Coopers Stout, in the Museum post tour. The museum features a display of the historic horse and cart, vintage Coopers delivery truck, and pictorials showcasing the history of the brewery.</p>",
    "short_description": "<p>Australians think of Adelaide as a city of churches, but Adelaide has outgrown its reputation as a sleepy country town dotted with cathedrals and spires. The Adelaide of this millennium is infinitely more complex, with a large, multiethnic population and thriving urban art and music scenes supported by a \"space activation program\" that encourages pop-up shops, markets, performances, street food, mini festivals, art exhibitions, and other \"off-the-cuff\" experiences in the cities underutilized streets and public spaces.</p><p>Bright and clean, leafy and beautiful Adelaide is a breeze to explore, with a grid pattern of streets encircled by parkland.

    "description": "<span style=\"font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\"></span><p>Antwerp is Europe's second-largest port and has much of the zest often associated with a harbor town. But it also has an outsized influence in a very different realm: that of clothing design. Since the 1980s, Antwerp-trained fashion designers have become renowned for experimental styles paired with time-honored workmanship. Several designers, such as Dries Van Noten and Ann Demeulemeester, stay firmly rooted in the city; others have filtered into major European couture houses. On their home turf, you can experience the fascinating mix of tradition and innovation that influences their work. In its heyday, Antwerp (Antwerpen in Flemish, Anvers in French) played second fiddle only to Paris. Thanks to artists such as Rubens, Van Dyck, and Jordaens, it was one of Europe's leading art centers. Its printing presses produced missals for the farthest reaches of the Spanish empire. It became, and has remained, the diamond capital of the world. Its civic pride was such that the Antwerpen Sinjoren (patricians) considered themselves a cut above just about everybody else. <br /><b><br />Sights</b><br /><br />The area that surrounds Centraal Station, Antwerp's magnificent railway station, is in the commercial center of the city, but is not representative of its character. Hop on the subway to Groenplaats and walk past the cathedral and then into the Grote Markt. This is where Antwerp begins.<br /><b><br />Dining<br /></b><br />Antwerp cuisine understandably focuses on fish, presented with few frills in even the finest restaurants, often poached or steamed, and reasonably priced. From the chilled whelks and periwinkles (marine snails) picked out of their shells with pins, to piles of tender little <i>grijze garnalen</i> (small shrimp), to the steamy white flesh of the mammoth <i>tarbot</i> (turbot), the scent of salt air is never far from your table. The ubiquitous <i>mosselen</i> (mussels) and <i>paling</i> (eels), showcased in midpriced restaurants throughout the city center, provide a heavier, heartier version of local fish cuisine. Bought live from wholesalers, the seafood is irreproachably fresh.<br /><br />Antwerp has a high number of restaurants for a city its size. Many of the traditional places, both formal and casual, are clustered in Oude Stad. There are plenty of tourist-focused restaurants on the Grote Markt, but if you look along the smaller streets around the square you'll find some excellent local favorites. Het Zuid, meanwhile, is known for trendier cafés and restaurants. Peak dining hours are generally from noon until 3 and from 8 pm to 11 or midnight. Since the dining scene is quite busy, it's best to make reservations.<br /><br /><b>Hotels</b><br /><br />Antwerp's hotels with the most character are generally found in the Oude Stad and its adjacent neighborhoods. There are several intimate boutique hotels, but as these can fill up far in advance, be sure to make reservations as early as possible. Some hotels have set prices throughout the year but many offer weekend rates. All hotels include taxes (6%) in their room rates. The city's tourism</p><div class=\"category-content-more\"><p> bureau, Toerisme Antwerpen, keeps track of the best hotel prices and can make reservations for you up to a week in advance. Write or e-mail (<i>toerisme@<span class=\"skimlinks-unlinked\">stad.antwerpen.be</span></i>) for a reservation form.<br /><br />Nightlife</p></div><p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" align=\"justify\"></p><p>There are 2,500 taverns in Antwerp—one for every 200 inhabitants—and the city is the club-going capital of Belgium, which means that the centers of nightlife are abuzz until the wee hours of the morning.</p><p>Along the waterfront at <b>Vlaamse Kaai</b> and <b>Waalse Kaai</b> there's a large parking square where you'll find some of Antwerp's biggest clubs as well as a group of smaller pubs.&nbsp;Be advised, though, that they share the area with Antwerp's red-light district.<br /><br /><b>Shopping</b><br /><br />Much of Antwerp's reputation for edgy chic comes from its clothing designers; dedicated followers of fashion consider the city in a league with Milan and Paris, and Antwerp-based couturiers regularly appear in the international glossies. Credit for this development goes to the so-called Antwerp Six (students of Linda Loppa from the class of 1981 at Antwerp's Fashion Academy) and in equal measure\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><div class=\"content-more\"><p> to the new wave of talent that has more recently stormed the catwalks. Ready-to-wear by stalwarts Ann Demeulemeester, Dirk Bikkembergs, Dries Van Noten, Martin Margiela, and relative newcomers Raf Simons, Véronique Branquinho, and Wim Neels command high prices. However, in the shopping area south of Groenplaats, prices are less astronomical.

    "short_description": "<p>Wandering the narrow streets of central Antwerp (Antwerpen in Flemish, Anvers in French), it's easy to see why it often suffers in comparison with Belgium's heavyweight destinations. It struggles to compete with the Art Deco bravado of Brussels or the sheer medieval nobility of Gent and Brugge. Instead, as befits a successful port, Antwerp is the city that embraced its commercial heritage, becoming the shopping capital of Belgium. But there's more to it than just high-streets. Dig a little deeper and you'll discover a vibrant, youthful city that doesn't just trade on its illustrious history, but is actually building on it.</p><p>In its heyday, Antwerp played second fiddle only to Paris. Thanks to artists such as Rubens, Van Dyck, and Jordaens, it was once one of Europe's leading art centers. Its printing presses produced missals for the farthest reaches of the Spanish empire, and it became, and has remained, the diamond capital of the world. Its civic pride was also such that the Antwerpen <em>Sinjoren</em> (patricians) considered themselves a cut above just about everybody else. Arguably, they still do.</p><p>Much of these achievements were built on the success of its port. During the 16th century, Antwerp's waters controlled the world's trade in silver, pepper, and textiles, putting it among the wealthiest cities on Earth. Sadly, the centuries of wars and conflicts that followed put an abrupt end to its golden age. However, a 10-year rebuilding program in the 1960s transformed it into the second-largest port in Europe. Consequently, it has much of the zest often associated with a harbor town. And just as in its earlier heyday, it retains an outsized influence in some unexpected realms. </p><p>Since the 1980s, Antwerp-trained fashion designers have become renowned for experimental styles paired with time-honored workmanship. Several designers, such as Dries Van Noten and Ann Demeulemeester, stay firmly rooted in the city; others have filtered into major European couture houses. On their home turf, you can experience the fascinating mix of tradition and innovation that influences their work. </p><p>Antwerp is not just a shopping mecca, though. Its grey, industrial roots have been thoroughly plucked and dyed. South of the center (Het Zuid), in an area once notable only for its red light district, has been transformed by an influx of upmarket bars, restaurants, galleries, and museums. Meanwhile, the city's hipper crowd gathers around youthful Mechelseplein, where a sprinkling of cafés, bars, and arts venues have cropped up in recent years. It is also the clubland capital of the country. </p><p>Often, Belgium's tourist-orientated cities seem hamstrung by their past. In Antwerp, you'll find a zesty, modern metropolis accented by some beautiful churches and cathedrals. It's this mix of old and new that makes it one of the country's most underrated destinations. </p>",

    "description": "<p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" align=\"justify\">There is a wonderful Italo Calvino story about a city so removed from its own history that it is as if the modern metropolis sits on the site of an unrelated ancient city that just happens to bear the same name. At times Alexandria, which Alexander the Great founded in the 4th century BC, feels like that. Yet the fallen Alexandria of the ancient Greeks, of Ptolemy, Cleopatra, Julius Caesar, and the Romans, and of pagan cults and the Great Library is underfoot, quite literally, as all of modern Alexandria has been built on the ruins of the old, a city that was capital of Egypt from the 3rd century BC until AD 642, when the Arabs first arrived. Overlay a map of the contemporary city with one from antiquity, and you see that many of the streets have remained the same: Shar'a al-Horreya runs along the route of the ancient Canopic Way, and Shar'a Nabi Daniel follows the route of the ancient Street of the Soma. Near their intersection once stood the Mouseion, a Greek philosophic and scientific center that had at its heart the collection of the Great Library. Yet only fleeting glimpses of this ancient city peak through the modern crust. By the early 20th century, Alexandria was a wealthy trading port. The merchants were fantastically rich—cosmopolitan without beingintellectual—and they enjoyed the sort of idle existence that is born of privilege, a privilege not of high birth but rather of colonial rule, which shielded foreigners from Egyptian law. They lived in villas with extravagant gardens, frequented luxurious shops, gossiped over tea in grand cafés, and lounged on the beach in private resorts along the coast. The population was a multicultural mix of Greeks and Arabs, Turks and Armenians, French and Levantines, Jews and Christians, and this spawned a unique atmosphere. It was this city that belonged to Constantine Cavafy, now regarded as the greatest Greek poet of his era. It was this city to which the novelist E.M. Forster, author of A Passage to India, was posted during World War I. And it was this city that gave birth to Lawrence Durrell's Alexandria Quartet, which captivated a generation of American readers when the books were published in the late 1950s. Then quite suddenly everything changed. The intellectuals and merchants fled, driven out of Egypt by the nationalist revolution of the 1950s, the wars with Israel, and the nationalization of their businesses. It's been five decades since most of the foreigners left—some Greeks and Armenians remained. But if you take the city as it is today and not as a faded version of what it once was, you will find that Alex (as it's affectionately known) remains an utterly charming place to visit. The Mediterranean laps at the seawall along the Corniche, and gentle sea breezes cool and refresh even in the dead of summer. Graceful old cafés continue to draw lovers and friends—Egyptians now, rather than foreigners—while the streets remain as lively and intriguing as ever. Alexandria is still a great city, even now, shorn of its many pasts.<br /><b><br />Sights</b><br /><br />Alexandria has grown so rapidly in the last 50 years that it now runs along the coastline from the Western Harbor all the way to Montazah, a distance of more than 16 km (10 mi). It is, nonetheless, a great walking city because the historic Downtown occupies a compact area near the Eastern Harbor, while the ancient sights are a short taxi ride away.<br /><br /><b>Dining<br /></b><br />Alexandria's culinary gift is extraordinary seafood, drawing on the best of the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. The preparation tends to be simple: grilled or fried, perhaps laced with garlic, herbs, or butter, and typically served with <i>tahini</i> (sesame paste) and a couple of salads on the side. The ingredients are so fresh that anything more elaborate would obscure their flavors. Most places display their offerings of fish, shrimp, crab, calamari, and mussels on ice, and you pay by weight or per serving. The price includes preparation and everything else—there are no hidden costs. If you need help choosing, there will always be someone on hand to guide your selection.<br /><br />Because the focus is on fresh seafood, restaurants in Alexandria (especially the good ones) tend to be informal and quite inexpensive for the quality of what they serve. Naturally, many are near the water, some of them appropriately weathered, while others consist of no more than a few tables in an alley. A few places will levy a service charge, but most will not. In all places a tip of 10% is appropriate. Do not expect alcohol to be served in most restaurants.<br /><br />Off-season, Alexandrians eat meals at standard times: 1 to 3 for lunch and 8 to 11 for dinner. But in summer dinner often begins much later. There is nothing more Mediterranean about Alexandria than the pace of dinner in the summer: after an evening siesta, have a <i>shisha</i> (water pipe) around 11, arrive at a waterfront restaurant after midnight, then wrap up the meal with an early morning espresso at an outdoor café nearby. You don't have to eat so late, of course, but you might be surprised how seductive it is.<br /><br /><b>Hotels</b><br /><br />Hotels in Alexandria are located in two clusters that are roughly 30 minutes apart. Upscale resort hotels are all out along the eastern shoreline in Montazah, close to or even within the manicured khedivial palace gardens—but not convenient to the city or the historic sights. Lower-budget hotels are almost all Downtown, much more convenient but less tranquil.<br /><br />In truth, with the exception of the Salamlek Palace and the Four Seasons, the luxury hotels in Alexandria are drab, generic places not worth what they charge. Fortunately, a couple of mid-range hotels, including the surprisingly elegant Metropole, make attractive alternatives in the city center. Summer is a busy season, when advance reservations are essential. In spring and fall you may find hotels fully booked on weekends (Friday through Sunday), when residents of Cairo head to Alexandria for some downtime. Outside peak summer season, most hotels discount their prices by 30% to 40%. Many hotels quote prices in U.S. dollars or euros, but if you pay with a credit card, your payment will be charged in the equivalent of Egyptian pounds.<br /><br /><b>Nightlife</b><br /><br />The joke among foreign residents in Alex is that if you want nightlife, go to Cairo. Things aren't quite that dire, but you'll still find that your nocturnal activities lean toward the wholesome rather than the iniquitous. Some top-end hotels have what pass for discos, and the Salamlek has a casino, but the city as a whole is definitely quieter than the capital.<br /><br /><b>Shopping</b><br /><br />Alexandria isn't a shopping city. There's little to buy here that you can't do better finding in Cairo, where the selection is much greater. If you're looking for chain stores, try Shar'a Suriya in Roushdi, Alexandria's most upscale neighborhood (15 minutes east of Downtown by taxi), or one of the new shopping malls that have opened up in the past few years.<br /><b><br />Arts/Entertainment<br /></b><br />The arts scene in Alex lags way behind Cairo, but there are some beacons of interest to explore. Although Alexandria has a couple of annual and biennial festivals, none would warrant a special trip to Alexandria in itself; however, several events are worth attending if you're in town when they're on.</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>    <br />    <p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>    <br />    <p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\" align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br /></p>",

    "description": "<p>Aomori's main event is its Nebuta Matsuri Festival,held August 2 to 7. People come to see illuminated floats of gigantic samurai figures paraded through the streets at night. Aomori's festival is one of Japan's largest, and is said to celebrate the euphoria of post-battle victory, and is thus encouraged to be noisier and livelier than you may have been exposed to in other Japanese festivals. Dancers, called heneto, run alongside the floats, dancing crazily, and you're encouraged to join in. Throughout the year you can enjoy delicious seafood from Aomori Bay, including Oma no Maguro (tuna of Oma), as well as delicious fruits and vegetables (particularly garlic). And come every summer, the town cuts loose to throw the decidedly wild Nebuta Matsuri festival, a frenzied, utterly unaccountable period when normal gets thrown to the wind.<br /><br /><b>Dining<br /><br />Nishimura<br /></b><br />It would be hard to walk out of this Japanese restaurant hungry: The <i>danna-shu</i> course (¥3,150), for example, includes abalone and sea-urchin soup, seaweed and fish, a mixed hot pot, and fried eggplant. On sunny days you should come for lunch. Both the great-value <i>teishoku</i> set menus and splendid bay views from the 10th floor of the lofty ASPAM building are all yours.<br /><b><br />Hide-zushi</b><br /><br />You're in a major seafood city, and if you want some of the  best of what is available in these cold waters, this is the place to get it.  Excellent service and bright surroundings, not to mention sea urchin, salmon  roe, scallops, squid, tuna, and ark shell (a variety of clam) await your whetted  appetite.<br /><br /><b>Ippa-zushi</b></p><p>What was once an early-20th-century warehouse is now a modern  sushi restaurant. The fish here is fresh, and the price is right, with a price  list clearly hung in the wall. The casual atmosphere makes it popular among  business travelers. The fish served varies according to the season and  availability, but tuna almost always appears.<br /><br /><b>Mitsu-ishi</b><br /><br />Crowded with locals, Mitsu-ishi has a convivial atmosphere and dishes that appeal to everyone. Sashimi <i>moriawase</i> (assorted sashimi; ¥1,200–¥2,500) is an excellent choice for two or three people. Grilled scallops and grilled chicken with herbs are also tasty and popular. The <i>mitsu-ishi gozen</i> (¥2,000) and <i>hime kaiseki</i> (¥3,000) set menus include sashimi, tempura, grilled fish, vegetables, rice, soup, and fruit. There's an abundant sake list, too. If you're in the mood for drinks and some finger food, take a seat at the bar, where the chef sometimes hands out complimentary snacks over the counter. Look for the mood-lit white building with boxy dark roof.<br /><br /><b>Sights<br /><br />Nebuta Village Museum</b><br /><br />If you can't visit during the Nebuta Festival, head to this museum in the southeast part of town where glowing papier-mâché sculptures painted with the fierce countenances of warriors used in Aomori's festival are displayed. From JR Aomori Station, take the bus bound for Moya Hills (25 minutes; ¥450) and get off at Nebuta no Sato Iriguchi stop.<br /><br /><b>Auga</b><br /><br />Fish, shellfish, preserved seaweed, and fish eggs—in short, all  manner of marine organisms—are hawked by hundreds of vendors in this seafood  market. It's one block east of JR Aomori Station, in the basement level of a  modern building with distinctive crimson pillars.<br /><br /><b>Murata Kōgei<br /><br /></b>A variety of Tsugaru lacquerware and handicrafts made in  Aomori and Tohoku are available at reasonable prices here. If you are into folk  art, it is fun just to poke around even if you don't buy anything. It's on  Shinmachi Dori, a short walk from the station.<br /><br /><b>Sannai Maruyama Iseki<br /><br /></b>Want to know what it was like to live in this area 5,500 years ago? This, one of the country's largest archaeological sites, features a reconstruction of a Jomon settlement that lasted for roughly 1,500 years, from 3500 BC to 2000 BC. After an extensive excavation, it was opened to the public and has attracted crowds of children on school outings, people wanting to trace their roots, and, of course, archaeology buffs. Its interactive approach encourages visitors to try crafts making and cuisine.<br /><b><br />Aomori Kenritsu Bijutsukan</b><br /><br />This contemporary arts museum houses a collection of works by Munakata Shiko (1903–75), Nara Yoshitomo (1959–) and Terayama Shuji (1935–83). Another highlight is three of Marc Chagall's backdrops created for the ballet <i>Aleko</i> (the fourth belongs to the Philadelphia Museum of Art). Unlike many museums in which gift shops are near the entrance and packed with people, the gift shop here sits quietly in a corner upstairs, seemingly asking visitors to enjoy art first before shopping. Outside, a statue of Aomori-ken (<i>ken</i> sounds like both prefecture and dog) waits in front of his food dish.</p><p> <br /></p>",

The coastline here is strung with line after line of rocky reefs (in fact, \"reef\" is what arrecife means in Spanish). While you're here, don't miss its two castles or its inland saltwater lagoon, Charco de San Ginés, where there's a gorgeous fleet of small fishing craft. A stroll around the back streets near the lagoon gives you an idea of the old Arrecife. The local Playa del Reducto is a good place to get in some beach time if you’re spending the day here. From Arrecife, you might want to walk or bike to Puerto del Carmen along the 12-km (7½-mile) seafront promenade, which takes in lovely stretches of golden sand and views of the Ajaches mountains in the south. You can stop for a bite to eat in Playa Honda. Take the bus back if you’re not up to the return trip.<br /><br /><b>Shopping</b><br /><br />Shopping is low-key in Arrecife. The main shops are on and around the pedestrian-only Calle León<b> </b>y Castilla.<br /><br /><b>Dining<br /><br />Lilium</b><br /><br />Creative cooking with Canarian roots is the philosophy behind the dishes at this modern restaurant that's just around the corner from the beach. Although there are a few tables outdoors, the dining mainly takes place inside, where copper and chocolate tones accompany floral touches. Standout dishes here include plantain croquettes and a slow-cooked suckling pig, served with a fruit reduction. Reservations are a good idea on weekends.<br /><br /><b>Sights<br /><br /></b><b>Museo de Arte Contemporáneo</b><br /><br />The old, waterfront fortress <b>Castillo San José</b> was turned into this stunning museum by the architect César Manrique. One of his paintings is on display, along with other modern Spanish works.<br /><b><br />Castillo San Gabriel</b><br /><br />The Castillo San Gabriel is a double-wall fortress once used to keep pirates at bay. A museum, due to open in 2013, will cover important events in the city's past.<br /><br /><b>Playa del Reducto<br /></b><br />It may not be in the same league as some of the beaches in the south, but Playa del Reducto is still an attractive urban beach, ideal for relaxing after you've looked around Arrecife. It's well maintained and protected by natural reefs, so swimming is usually like swimming in a warm lake (though do watch out for rocky outcrops at low tide). The beach is backed by a pleasant promenade that goes all the way to Puerto del Carmen. <br /><b>Amenities:</b> food and drink; showers; toilets. <b>Best for:</b> sunrise; walking.</p>",

The village lies on the edge of a shallow lagoon protected from the open ocean by a series of fringing and submerged barrier reefs that support substantial coral growth. The reefs around Andavadoaka represent some of the most well-developed coral reef systems in the Indian Ocean, and owing to the remote setting and geographic isolation, they are thought to possess a significantly higher abundance and diversity of species than other reefs in southwest Madagascar. As such the reefs are a vital resource for local artisanal fishery of the Vezo fishing people, who are known for their dependence upon the ocean.",

Considered one of the Outer Seychelles Islands, Assumption is part of the Aldabra Group, lying approximately 600 miles (960 km) southwest of Mahé, in the Indian Ocean. These outer islands are not made from granite, like their larger sisters Mahé, Praslin or La Digue, but rather are coralline formations. Once a part of the French colony Réunion, then a member of the British Indian Ocean Territories, today Assumption is governed by the Seychelles. Assumption is a rough and arid island, shaded only by shrubs and palm trees but is redeemed by a spectacular reef with huge coral heads and a white ocean floor. Jacques Cousteau said he'd never seen any other place on earth with same clarity of water or diversity of reef life. He filmed large parts of documentary “The Silent World” here, and held audiences across the globe, spellbound by the magic that lay beneath the sea. A notable feature of this island is the Assumption Island day gecko, a subspecies of gecko found only on this island. Assumption is also a known nesting site for turtles and rare birds. Because Assumption Island was found to be rich in guano, coveted for its phosphorous fertilizing abilities, it was essentially plundered in the early 1900s. The island today is has an interesting geography that includes a gorgeous 3-mile (5-km) white beach, a rocky coastline, caves, and two very large sand dunes prominent on the south eastern coast of the island, one of them reaching 104 feet (32 metres) high. There is a very small settlement with less than 10 registered inhabitants, mostly in place to service the small landing strip used by scientists with permission to study the neighbouring Aldabra Atoll. The settlement is surrounded by Casuarina trees and there is an abandoned coconut palm plantation to its south. Pier Information The ship will be anchored off the coast of Assumption and tenders will land on the shoreline. We recommend you wear sturdy walking shoes, sun hats or scarves and bring your camera.

    "description": "Arica boasts that it is \"the land of the eternal spring,\" but its temperate climate and beaches are not the only reason to visit this small city. Relax for an hour or two on the Plaza 21 de Mayo. Walk to the pier and watch the pelicans and sea lions trail the fishing boats as the afternoon's catch comes in. Walk to the top of the Morro and imagine battles of days gone by, or wonder at the magnitude of  modern shipping as Chilean goods leave the port below by container ship. Arica is gaining notice for its great surfing conditions, and in 2009 hosted the Rusty Arica Pro Surf Challenge, a qualifying event to the world series of surf. <br /><br /><b>Dining<br /><br />Maracuyá</b><br />Wicker furniture enhances the cool South Pacific atmosphere of this pleasant, open-air restaurant that literally sits above the water on stilts. The international menu focuses on fish. The seafood, lauded by locals, is always fresh; ask the waiter what the fishing boats brought in that day. House specialties include octopus grilled in lemon and olive oil, salmon in an orange sauce, and sea bass in the pineapple-flavored salsa amazonia.<br /><b><br />Casino La Bomba</b><br />In the old fire station, Casino La Bomba is more of a cultural curiosity than a culinary one. That said, the traditional food isn't bad, and the service is friendly. You'll have to manoeuvre  around the parked fire trucks to get inside, where you are greeted by dried crocodile hides and a menu heavy on grilled fish and roasted chicken.<br /><br /><b>Club de Deportes Náuticos</b><br />This old yacht club with views of the port serves succulent seafood dishes in a relaxed terrace setting. One of the friendliest restaurants in town, this former men's club is a great place to meet the old salts of the area. Bring your fish stories.<br /><b><br />El Rey de Mariscos</b><br />Locals love this seafood restaurant, and for good reason. The corvina con salsa margarita (sea bass in a seafood-based sauce) is a winner, as is the paila marina, a hearty soup stocked with all manner of fish. The dreary fluorescent lights and faux-wood paneling give this restaurant on the second story of a concrete-block building an undeserved down-at-the-heels air.<br /><br /><b>Nightlife</b><br />You can join the locals for a beer at one of the cafés lining the pedestrian mall of 21 de Mayo. These low-key establishments, many with outdoor seating, are a great place to spend an afternoon watching the passing crowds. An oddity in Arica is the attire of the servers in various tranquil cafés and tea salons (usually called \"café con piernas\" or \"cafés with legs\"): women serve coffee and tea dressed in lingerie.<br />In the evening you won't have trouble finding the city's many watering holes.<br /><br /><b>Barrabas</b><br />For a more refined setting, try the lively, funky Barrabas, a bar and adjoining disco that attracts Arica's younger set.<br /><br /><b>Discoteca SoHo</b><br /><br />Discoteca SoHo, near Playa Chinchorro, livens things up weekends with the sounds of pop and cumbia.<br /><br /><b>Puesta del Sol</b><br />The beachfront Puesta del Sol plays '80s tunes and appeals to a slightly older crowd. Weekends you can enjoy live music on the pleasant terrace.<br /><br /><b>Shopping</b><br /><br /><b>Calle 21 de Mayo</b><br />Calle 21 de Mayo is a good place for window-shopping.<br /><br /><b>Calle Bolognesi</b><br />Calle Bolognesi, just off Calle 21 de Mayo, is crowded with artisan stalls selling handmade goods.<br /><br /><b>Feria Internacional</b><br />The Feria Internacional on Calle Máximo Lira sells everything from bowler hats (worn by Aymara women) to blankets to batteries. The Terminal Pesquero next door offers an interesting view of fishing, El Norte Grande's predominant industry.<br /><br /><b>Poblado Artesenal</b><br />Located outside the city in the Azapa Valley, the Poblado Artesenal is an artisan cooperative designed to resemble an altiplano community. This is a good place to pick up traditionally styled ceramics and leather. <br /><br /><b>Calle Chacabuco</b><br />The length of Calle Chacabuco, four blocks north of Calle 21 de Mayo, is closed to traffic on Sunday for a market featuring everything from soccer jerseys to bootleg CDs.<br /><br /><b>Sights</b><br /><br /><b>Iglesia de San Marcos</b><br />Located on the Plaza Colón, the Iglesia de San Marcos was erected in 1876 and was constructed entirely from iron. Alexandre Gustave Eiffel, designer of that famed eponymous Parisian tower, had the individual pieces cast in France before bringing them to Arica.<br /><b><br />Aduana de Arica</b><br />Across from the Parque General Baquedano, the Aduana de Arica, the city's former customs house, is one of Eiffel's creations. It currently contains the town's cultural center, where you can find exhibits about northern Chile, old photographs of Arica, and works by local painters and sculptors.<br /><br />Estación FerrocarrilNorth of Parque General Baquedano is the defunct train station for the Arica—La Paz railroad. Though trains no longer run across the mountains to the Bolivian capital, there are round-trip journeys four times a week to the altiplano. The 1913 building houses a small museum with a locomotive and other remnants of the railroad.<br /><br /><b>El Morro de Arica</b><br />Hanging over the town, this fortress is impossible to ignore. This former Peruvian stronghold was the site of one of the key battles in the War of the Pacific. The fortress now houses the Museo de las Armas, which commemorates that battle. As you listen to the proud drum roll of military marches, you can wander among the uniforms and weapons of past wars.Museo Arqueológico de San Miguel de AzapaA visit here is a must for anyone who travels to El Norte Grande. In an 18th-century olive-oil refinery, this museum houses an impressive collection of artifacts from the cultures of the Chinchorros (a coastal people) and Tijuanacotas (a group that lived in the antiplano). Of particular interest are the Chinchorro mummies, the oldest in the world, dating to 6000 BC. The incredibly well—preserved mummies are arranged in the fetal position, which was traditional in this area. To look into their wrinkled, expressive faces is to get a glimpse at a history that spans more than 8,000 years. The tour ends at an olive press that functioned until 1956, a reminder of the still-thriving industry in the surrounding valley. The museum is a short drive from Arica. You can also make the 20-minute journey by colectivo from Patricio Lynch for about 600 pesos.<br /><br /><b>Playa El Laucho</b><br />South of El Morro, Playa El Laucho is the closest to the city, and thus the most crowded. It's also a bit rocky at the bottom.<br /><br /><b>Playa Brava</b><br />South of Playa El Laucho you'll find Playa Brava, with a pontoon that keeps the kids occupied.<br /><br /><b>Playa Chinchorro</b><br />At the somewhat secluded white-sand Playa Chinchorro, 2 km (1 mi) north of the city, you can rent Jet Skis in high season.<br /><br /><b>Museo del Mar</b><br />A newcomer to the Arica museum scene, this is a well-maintained and colorful collection of more than 1,000 seashells and oceanic oddities from around the world. The owner has traveled the globe for more than 30 years to bolster his collection, which includes specimens from Africa, Asia, and you guessed it—Arica.<br /><br /><b>Huntington Surf Shop</b><br />A shop on the main pedestrian mall, Huntington Surf Shop caters to those brought into town by the waves.<br /><br /><b>Escuela de Surf</b><br />Arica also has a surfing school, Escuela de Surf.",

Set on the southern coast, and spanning seven islands, Arendal is a place to slow the pace, and unwind surrounded by Norway’s easy-going beauty. Ferries – and boat hiring opportunities - make exploring easy, or you can get out on foot or two wheels to throw yourself into the thick of the area’s outstanding natural beauty. <br /> <br />Arendal's twin lighthouses are the first thing you'll see, as your ship leaves the open ocean, and heads to Arendal itself. The perfect focal point for any photo, Store Torungen is still in working order - witness it flashing its warnings to passing ships, as they navigate the tricky islands and skerries that are scattered across the waters. Cafes and shell-fish sellers welcome you to the city centre as you step off the ship, and you’re immediately well placed to slow the pace, and wander beside glistening water. Or, why not stretch your legs by escaping to the countryside and cycling along wooden pathways that skirt glistening lakes?<br /> <br />The glorious Tyholmen district offers quaint, historical wooden houses, and they’re an authentic throwback to the town and region as it existed back in the 17th century. The old, wooden town hall was constructed around 1812, and is the area's most impressive building - a whitewash, wooden structure, laced with flowers. Its image reflects poetically in the water over which it stands.<br /> <br />For a bite to eat, or a drink to round off the day, head to the Pollen district, where you'll find a welcoming cluster of pubs and eateries. Canal Street offers waterside jazz - especially in July, when the Jazz Festival swings into life. Skagerrak Cathedral, meanwhile, is another of the town's prettiest buildings, and is decorated with arching wooden naves and glowing stained glass windows. Nearby Merdo provides a peaceful visit, with cars banished from the island. Sail across the waves to charming beaches that are guarded by copper-red wooden houses, and handsome little piers. Spornes Beach begs to be strolled, and summons you to soak in its sea-views, and to jump between boulders that lie strewn across its scenic cove.",

Or, why not stretch your legs by escaping to the countryside and cycling along wooden pathways that skirt glistening lakes?",

While it may be one of the most northerly locations in Europe, you'll find a milder climate waiting here than in many other locations of a similar latitude, and quickly feel at home in this impressively cosmopolitan town. Alta’s located in Norway’s most northern region, and although it’s Finnmark's most populated town, extraordinary adventure beckons, as you explore this wild landscape of ice and snow. <br /><br />Scorch across the ice on a husky-pulled sledge, or open up the throttle on your snowmobile, as you explore the pristine, frozen landscapes of Finnmark. Incredible fjords crack open the ground, and in summer you can witness the magical sight of the sun shining on all night - teasing the horizon with a gentle bow before rising again. At other times of the year, the velvety black, star-speckled sky is illuminated by streaks of emerald green smoke, as nature's greatest show begins in full Technicolor.<br /><br />While the area surrounding Alta has remained largely untouched by humans over the years, there's incredible evidence of pre-historic settlements at Hjemmeluft, a World Heritage Site where 3,000 images are carved into the rock. These ancient daubings depict everything from bears to elk, and even human skiers. Explore the area's incredible history at the museum, which is located on the site of an 11,000-year-old settlement.An overnight stay in the Sorrisniva Igloo Hotel will live long in the memory, as you snuggle into a thick reindeer hide, and sleep in a 30-bedroom hotel crafted entirely from the ice and snow of winter. Enjoy a refreshing drink in the ice bar, before warming up from the sub-zero temperatures by dipping into a toasty hot tub, which froths below the stars.<br /><br />",

On the southern side of the peninsula, in a harbor created when the crater wall of an extinct volcano collapsed into the sea, nestles the fishing village of Akaroa (Maori for \"long harbor\"). The port is a favouite day trip for Christchurch residents on Sunday drives and on weekends.\n</p><p>\n<b>Sights</b>\n</p><p>\nAlthough Akaroa was chosen as the site for a French colony in 1838, the first French settlers arrived in 1840 only to find that the British had already established sovereignty over New Zealand by the Treaty of Waitangi. Less than 10 years later, the French abandoned their attempt at colonization, but the settlers remained and gradually intermarried with the local English community. Apart from the rue (street) names, a few family surnames, and architectural touches, there is little sign of a French connection anymore, but the village has splendid surroundings.\n </p><p>  \nAmble along the narrow streets past old-fashioned little cottages and historic buildings which reflect the area's multicultural background. A free map that outlines the walk and points of interest is available from the information center. You can start this easy two-hour walk at the Akaroa Information Centre at 80 Rue Levaud.\n</p><p>   \nAkaroa Museum. Along the waterfront from the Garden of Tlections and displays tell some of the exciting stories of Kai Tahu, the people of the land. The museum complex includes the Old Courthouse and Langlois-Eteveneaux House, the two-room cottage of an early French settler.\n</p><p>   \nAlong the waterfront from the Garden of Tane to Jubilee Park, the focus of historic interest is the Akaroa Museum, which has a display of Maori pounamu (greenstone) as well as alternating exhibits on the area's multicultural past. The Peninsula supported a significant Maori population and the collections and displays tell some of the exciting stories of Kai Tahu, the people of the land. The museum complex includes the Old Courthouse and Langlois-Eteveneaux House, the two-room cottage of an early French settler. Rue Lavaud at Rue Balguerie.

The 20-acre vineyard produces pinot gris, chardonnay, and pinot noir. The cellar door also has Akaroa Harbour merlot, riesling, and rosé, so there's something for everyone. The on-site restaurant is hailed for its rack of lamb and Akaroa salmon.\n </p><p>\nOkains Bay. The contrast of the rim of the old volcanic cone and the coves below is striking-and when you drop into one of the coves, you'll probably feel like you've found your own little corner of the world. One of the easiest bays to access is Okains Bay. Take the Summit Road at Hilltop if approaching from Christchurch, or Ngaio Point Road behind Duvauchelle if approaching from Akaroa. It's about 24 km (15 mi) from Akaroa and takes about a half hour to drive. The small settlement lies at the bottom of Okains Bay Road, which ends at a beach sheltered by tall headlands.\n </p><p>     \nThis collection of buildings contains 20,000 Maori and 19th-century colonial artifacts, including waka (canoes) used in Waitangi Day celebrations and displays such as a smithy and print shop. There are also a wharenui (Maori meetinghouse), colonial homes, including a totara slab cottage, and a saddlery and harness shop. Main Rd. Admission charged.\n</p><p>\nPohatu Marine Reserve is a key breeding area for the white-flippered penguin (korora), which are endemic to the Canterbury region. The best time for viewing is during the breeding season, September to January. You may also see the yellow-eyed penguin (hoiho). Options range from day and evening penguin or nature tours.

It measures a mere 7.5 miles by 6 miles, and its closest neighbor is the island of St. Helena, some 760 miles southeast, of which Ascension has been a dependency since 1922. The island is of volcanic origin; its climate is moderated by southeastern trade winds. The annual mean temperature is 85°F at sea level and 75°F on Green Mountain, which is at 2,870 feet the highest point on the island. The island was taken over by the British in 1815, at the same time that they took a greater interest in St. Helena for the purpose of sending Napoleon into exile. Until 1922, Ascension was under the direct supervision of the British Admiralty who maintained a small naval station here. In 1922, the island became a dependency of St. Helena and was placed under the control of the British colonial office. During World War II, the United States built an airfield here to guard the South Atlantic sea lanes. Today, the island serves mainly as a military base. It became of prime importance during the Falklands conflict between Britain and Argentina. From here, long distance jet aircraft brought supplies from the U.K. to the troops in the Falkland Islands. Ascension has no permanent indigenous population, but is used in varying capacities by the Royal Air Force, the British Broadcasting Corporation, Cable &amp; Wireless, the U.S. Air Force and NASA. Two military planes land here every week en route to and from the Falklands, and NASA does some of its moon testing here. The main settlement is Georgetown, home to some 200 residents who enjoy a very laid back lifestyle. A short walk from the pier takes you to the center of the tiny village, with a Post Office, two clubs and one main store. The shores of the island are known as a habitat for turtles, and the surrounding waters abound in fish. The island is surrounded by crystal-clear water and some beautiful beaches. But currents, sharks and strong undertow often make swimming hazardous.The visit of a cruise vessel provides an exciting occasion for the island's population. For our guests a visit to this remote locale will easily be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. You will be eagerly welcomed and happily shown every nook and cranny of the island. The infrastructure may be limited, but the charm of Ascension and the enthusiasm of its residents more than make up for it.<p></p><h3>Pier Information</h3>The ship is scheduled to anchor off the small settlement of Georgetown. Guests will be taken ashore via the ship’s tenders. Georgetown is about 600 feet from the pier. There are no taxis available on the island except for vehicles owned by residents.   <p></p><h3>Shopping</h3>You may want to check out the two shops in Georgetown and perhaps get an Ascension Island T-shirt or a souvenir to take home from this remote island. The local currency is the pound sterling, but U.S. dollars are accepted. <p></p><h3>Cuisine</h3>The Two Boat Club, which also has a bar, accepts visitors for lunch. <p></p><h3>Other Sites</h3>Wander around Georgetown and meet the residents, or find one that can be hired with his car to show you the island.",

On shore visit the local museum that houses the HMS Bounty Bible, the historic Adamstown Church, view Fletcher Christian’s cave, or keep an eye out for the Pitcairn Reed Warbler.",

Breathless romance hangs thick in the air here, especially when a riot of purples, reds and oranges are spreading across the sky, accompanying the sun's descent each evening.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><b><br />History</b><br /><br />It wasn't until 1789 that Europeans discovered this island haven, with the HMS Bounty's crew arriving, just a few weeks before a mutiny tore them apart. The Europeans were beaten to the islands, however, by the streamlined wooden canoes of the Polynesian settlers, who arrived around 900AD. While Western missionaries would eventually visit to spread Christianity to the island - evidenced by the white, coral-encrusted walls of the many churches - their efforts to repress the people’s deep love of communal singing and dancing ultimately failed, and music forms a key component of the islanders' culture to this day. <br /><br /><b>Top Sights and Activities</b><br /><br />The beaches here are flawless, and swaying in a hammock, suspended between leaning palm trees, as the ocean gently ruffles the sand nearby, feels gloriously indulgent. Aitutaki Lagoon is a huge aquamarine pool of water, alive with a kaleidoscopic swirl of tropical fish, which lurk just below the surface. You may even be lucky enough to spot turtles padding across the sand, scraping themselves towards the open ocean.<br /><br />The snorkelling opportunities here, and on One Foot Island - where you'll want to acquire the badge of honour of having your passport stamped with the island's iconic huge footprint - are sublime. Don't miss the tiny island of Moturakau either, which is crammed full of exotic birds and crabs, who have dominion over the island's tangled, jungle terrain.  <br /><br /><b>Museums</b><br /><br />Aitutaki has escaped over-development, and the vibrant pulse of the island’s culture is palpable from the second you arrive. Visits during July give you the honour of witnessing the Te Maeva Nui celebrations, during which the country dances and harmonises as one to celebrate the Cook Islands' self-governance. Feel your own limbs twitching, as you match the pounding drum rhythms of the traditional Ura Pau dance, which shakes the islands during this period.<br /><br /><b>Hotels &amp; Restaurants</b><br /><br />The relative inaccessibility of the atoll means there is a real sense of exclusivity here, and it's easy to feel mesmerised by the tranquil isolation as you wander out on a glorious sand bar, before wading back to your beach-side wooden cabin.<br /><br />Aitutaki Lagoon Resort &amp; Spa is one of the finest places to stay on the island, offering stress-extinguishing massages, below woven roofs, and bedrooms with colossal windows that reveal the glorious, island-studded ocean. Pacific Resort Aitutaki is another sumptuous option, where you can sip from coconut shells, before splashing in the ankle deep water of a private beach, or kayaking out across the gentle bob of the waves.<br /><br />The crackle of barbecuing seafood - which varies from swordfish to octopus, depending on the day's haul - is never far away here. Restaurants like the Pacific Resort's Rapae Bay serve up flavour-filled platters of seafood, while Koru Cafe is a laid-back option for a delicious lunch - enjoy salt and pepper squid, or rustic sandwiches bulked out with juicy local greens.<br /><br /><b>Shopping </b><br /><br />Aituaki is a small island, and chances are you'll want to spend your time on the beach rather than shopping. You can pick up limited supplies at the island's small gas stations, however, with fresh fruit - including juicy bananas and star fruit widely available. The hotels offer plenty of supplies for visiting guests.<br /><br />",

Considered the crossroads of West Africa both economically and culturally, Abidjan benefits from clement temperatures year round, reaching average highs of around 88˚ Fahrenheit, or 30˚ Celsius. Like much of West Africa, this city has cachet and soul, and enjoys a diversity of cultures, traditions and people, notably through the French influence (Abidjan is the largest French speaking country in West Africa), but also through the steady stream of tourists that make the city both vibrant and cosmopolitan. Although its reputation was tarnished during the civil war in 2011, Abidjan held firm and has blossomed into a stunning coastal city, ripe for exploration. \nThe French connection is clear to see all over the city and expect to find Parisian style bistros and gourmet restaurants dotted all over town. However, if your tastebuds prefer a more authentic and African experience, les maquis — local street food stalls — can be found spread out all over the city. Pull up a chair next to friendly locals, and dine out on specialities such as kedjenou (chicken with braised vegetables), attieke (cassava ground into couscous-like grains and eaten with fish or meat) and aloko, (fried banana served with onions and chillies). \nOriginally a fishing village, Abidjan is a city of stark contrasts. Local craft markets sit comfortably next to sprawling skyscrapers, so architecturally advanced that one might be forgiven for questioning whether you are not in fact in Manhattan. Tourists mingle side by side with natives, while children play football barefoot in the streets. Granted, the war may have left some aftermath, but overall this proud, beautiful city shows no signs of slowing down.",
    "short_description": "Three hours south of Yamoussoukro, nestled in between the canals and waterways, lies Abidjan the economic capital of the Ivory Coast. Considered the crossroads of West Africa both economically and culturally, Abidjan benefits from clement temperatures year round, reaching average highs of around 88˚ Fahrenheit, or 30˚ Celsius. Like much of West Africa, this city has cachet and soul, and enjoys a diversity of cultures, traditions and people, notably through the French influence, but also through the steady stream of tourists that make the city both vibrant and cosmopolitan. Although its reputation was tarnished during the civil war in 2011, Abidjan held firm and has blossomed into a stunning coastal city, ripe for exploration.",

It is the commercial center of Western Australia's southern region and the oldest settlement in the state, established in 1826.\n\n\nBoasting an excellent harbor on King George Sound led to Albany becoming a thriving whaling port. Later, when steam ships started traveling between England and Australia, Albany was an important coaling station and served as a penal and a military outpost.\nThe coastline offers some of Australia's most rugged and spectacular scenery. At certain times of the year, whales can be spotted off the coast. Among the city's attractions are some fine old colonial buildings that reflect Albany's Victorian heritage. Various lookout points offer stunning vistas. Factors such as moderate summer temperatures, an abundance of natural splendors and numerous points of historical interest make Albany one of the Southwest's main vacation spots. Its surrounding areas feature vineyards and several national parks, renowned for spectacular panoramas, beautiful scenery, large karri trees, granite outcrops and excellent bushwalks.\n\n\nPlease Note: For your convenience, shore excursions offered for this port of call are available to reserve in advance at www.silversea.com until (date), and will also be offered for purchase onboard, unless otherwise noted in the description.\n\n\nGoing Ashore in Albany\n\n\nPier Information\nThe ship is scheduled to dock at Albany Port. The distance to the city center is approximately one mile. Taxis are generally available at the pier.\nShopping\nSandalwood oil and local wines are popular items and can be found at various shops at the city center. The local currency is the Australian dollar. U.S. dollars are not readily accepted.\nCuisine\nAlbany shares the rest of the Southwest's laudable preoccupation with the quality of eating. From fine international cuisine and local wines to family restaurants, Albany offers a great variety of restaurants. The best choices can be found at Middleton Beach.\nOther Sights\nStirling Terrace and York Street\nStroll along these main streets and view the numerous original buildings from the days of the first settlement.\nBeaches\nMiddleton Beach and Ellen Cove are lovely swimming spots. The boardwalk at Ellen Cove is part of a dual-use walking and cycling path that winds its way around the city.\n\n\nPrivate arrangements for independent sightseeing may not be available in Albany due to the lack of qualified guides and suitable equipment.",

    "short_description": "Located on the Adriatic Sea, Ancona is the main town of the Marche region of Italy on the Adriatic Sea. Founded by Syracusian colonists about 390 BC, it was conquered by Rome in the 2nd century BC. Attacked by Goths, Lombards and Saracens, the city declined but recovered its importance in the Middle Ages. The city came under direct papal rule in 1532, which continued until Ancona became part of Italy in 1860. Though damaged by earthquakes and bombing World War II Ancona has many monuments and notable landmarks such as the Cathedral remodeled in the 12th and 13th-centuries and the Church of Santa Maria della Piazza. There are also a number of fine Gothic buildings including the National Museum of Marche. Today, situated on the slopes of the rocky promontory of Mount Conero, this once independent maritime republic is a busy port and the main point of embarkation for Greece and the former Yugoslavia.  Pier Information The ship is scheduled to dock at the Port of Ancona. The Stazione Marittima is about 15 minutes (100 yards) from the city center. Taxis are generally available at the pier.

At the foot of the famous Dome of St.Ciriaco, you can also find shops. Shops are closed between 12.30pm and 3.30pm, and on Sunday and Monday mornings.

    "short_description": "Guam is blessed with spectacular natural beauty and a rich cultural history. Apra Harbor is a deep-water port located on the western side of the island near the Mariana Islands and the Mariana Trench, which is the deepest part of the earth’s oceans, and the deepest location of the earth itself. The port serves both as a U.S. naval station and Guam’s main commercial port. The harbour, formed by the Orote Peninsula to the south and Cabras Island in the north, is considered to be one of the best natural ports in the Pacific. Guam’s unique culture, traditions and heritage have remained intact despite European imperialism, wars and changing foreign governments. Archaeological evidence suggests that the indigenous Chamorros of Indo-Malayan descent migrated from the Southeast Asian islands and settled throughout the Marianas archipelago. Being expert seamen and skilled craftsmen, they flourished and built unique houses and canoes suited to the region. As a matriarchal society and through the prestige of the women, much of the Chamorro culture and traditions were able to survive. Since the 16th century, a wave of foreigners have arrived on Guam’s shores, including Ferdinand Magellan in 1521 who remained on the island for three days to restock his small convoy. Americans, Asians, Europeans, Micronesians and other visitors have since left their imprint on the island’s pastimes and tastes.",
